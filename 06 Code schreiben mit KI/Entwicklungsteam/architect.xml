          All dependencies are bundled within this XML file as &lt;file&gt; elements with CDATA content.
        When you need to access a file path like "bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml":
        1. Find the &lt;file id="bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml"&gt; element in this document
        2. Extract the content from within the CDATA section
        3. Use that content as if you read it from the filesystem

  <workflow name="architecture">
        <critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
        <critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
        <critical>
          This workflow uses ADAPTIVE FACILITATION - adjust your communication style based on {user_skill_level}
        </critical>
        <critical>
          The goal is ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS that prevent AI agent conflicts, not detailed implementation specs
        </critical>
        <critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and tailor to {user_skill_level}</critical>
        <critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
        <critical>This workflow replaces architecture with a conversation-driven approach</critical>
        <critical>
          Input documents specified in workflow.yaml input_file_patterns - workflow engine handles fuzzy matching, whole vs sharded document discovery automatically
        </critical>
        <critical>
          ELICITATION POINTS: After completing each major architectural decision area (identified by template-output tags for decision_record, project_structure, novel_pattern_designs, implementation_patterns, and architecture_document), invoke advanced elicitation to refine decisions before proceeding
        </critical>
        <critical>
          ⚠️ ABSOLUTELY NO TIME ESTIMATES - NEVER mention hours, days, weeks, months, or ANY time-based predictions. AI has fundamentally changed development speed - what once took teams weeks/months can now be done by one person in hours. DO NOT give ANY time estimates whatsoever.

        <critical>
          ⚠️ CHECKPOINT PROTOCOL: After EVERY
          <template-output>
            tag, you MUST follow workflow.xml substep 2c: SAVE content to file immediately → SHOW checkpoint separator (━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━) → DISPLAY generated content → PRESENT options [a]Advanced Elicitation/[c]Continue/[p]Party-Mode/[y]YOLO → WAIT for user response. Never batch saves or skip checkpoints.

  ### Pattern Implementability
  
  - [ ] Pattern is implementable by AI agents with provided guidance
  - [ ] No ambiguous decisions that could be interpreted differently
  - [ ] Clear boundaries between components
  - [ ] Explicit integration points with standard patterns
  
  ---
  
  ## 5. Implementation Patterns
  
  ### Pattern Categories Coverage
  
  - [ ] **Naming Patterns**: API routes, database tables, components, files
  - [ ] **Structure Patterns**: Test organization, component organization, shared utilities
  - [ ] **Format Patterns**: API responses, error formats, date handling
  - [ ] **Communication Patterns**: Events, state updates, inter-component messaging
  - [ ] **Lifecycle Patterns**: Loading states, error recovery, retry logic
  - [ ] **Location Patterns**: URL structure, asset organization, config placement
  - [ ] **Consistency Patterns**: UI date formats, logging, user-facing errors
  
  ### Pattern Quality
  
  - [ ] Each pattern has concrete examples
  - [ ] Conventions are unambiguous (agents can't interpret differently)
  - [ ] Patterns cover all technologies in the stack
  - [ ] No gaps where agents would have to guess
  - [ ] Implementation patterns don't conflict with each other
  
  ---
  
  ## 6. Technology Compatibility
  
  ### Stack Coherence
  
  - [ ] Database choice compatible with ORM choice
  - [ ] Frontend framework compatible with deployment target
  - [ ] Authentication solution works with chosen frontend/backend
  - [ ] All API patterns consistent (not mixing REST and GraphQL for same data)
  - [ ] Starter template compatible with additional choices
  
  ### Integration Compatibility
  
  - [ ] Third-party services compatible with chosen stack
  - [ ] Real-time solutions (if any) work with deployment target
  - [ ] File storage solution integrates with framework
  - [ ] Background job system compatible with infrastructure
  
  ---
  
  ## 7. Document Structure
  
  ### Required Sections Present
  
  - [ ] Executive summary exists (2-3 sentences maximum)
  - [ ] Project initialization section (if using starter template)
  - [ ] Decision summary table with ALL required columns:
    - Category
    - Decision
    - Version
    - Rationale
  - [ ] Project structure section shows complete source tree
  - [ ] Implementation patterns section comprehensive
  - [ ] Novel patterns section (if applicable)
  
  ### Document Quality
  
  - [ ] Source tree reflects actual technology decisions (not generic)
  - [ ] Technical language used consistently
  - [ ] Tables used instead of prose where appropriate
  - [ ] No unnecessary explanations or justifications
  - [ ] Focused on WHAT and HOW, not WHY (rationale is brief)
  
  ---
  
  ## 8. AI Agent Clarity
  
  ### Clear Guidance for Agents
  
  - [ ] No ambiguous decisions that agents could interpret differently
  - [ ] Clear boundaries between components/modules
  - [ ] Explicit file organization patterns
  - [ ] Defined patterns for common operations (CRUD, auth checks, etc.)
  - [ ] Novel patterns have clear implementation guidance
  - [ ] Document provides clear constraints for agents
  - [ ] No conflicting guidance present
  
  ### Implementation Readiness
  
  - [ ] Sufficient detail for agents to implement without guessing
  - [ ] File paths and naming conventions explicit
  - [ ] Integration points clearly defined
  - [ ] Error handling patterns specified
  - [ ] Testing patterns documented
  
  ---
  
  ## 9. Practical Considerations
  
  ### Technology Viability
  
  - [ ] Chosen stack has good documentation and community support
  - [ ] Development environment can be set up with specified versions
  - [ ] No experimental or alpha technologies for critical path
  - [ ] Deployment target supports all chosen technologies
  - [ ] Starter template (if used) is stable and well-maintained
  
  ### Scalability
  
  - [ ] Architecture can handle expected user load
  - [ ] Data model supports expected growth
  - [ ] Caching strategy defined if performance is critical
  - [ ] Background job processing defined if async work needed
  - [ ] Novel patterns scalable for production use
  
  ---
  
  ## 10. Common Issues to Check
  
  ### Beginner Protection
  
  - [ ] Not overengineered for actual requirements
  - [ ] Standard patterns used where possible (starter templates leveraged)
  - [ ] Complex technologies justified by specific needs
  - [ ] Maintenance complexity appropriate for team size
  
  ### Expert Validation
  
  - [ ] No obvious anti-patterns present
  - [ ] Performance bottlenecks addressed
  - [ ] Security best practices followed
  - [ ] Future migration paths not blocked
  - [ ] Novel patterns follow architectural principles
  
  ---
  
  ## Validation Summary
  
  ### Document Quality Score
  
  - Architecture Completeness: [Complete / Mostly Complete / Partial / Incomplete]
  - Version Specificity: [All Verified / Most Verified / Some Missing / Many Missing]
  - Pattern Clarity: [Crystal Clear / Clear / Somewhat Ambiguous / Ambiguous]
  - AI Agent Readiness: [Ready / Mostly Ready / Needs Work / Not Ready]
  
  ### Critical Issues Found
  
  <!-- replace with list of critical issues found, or N/A -->
          ### Recommended Actions Before Implementation
          <!-- replace with list of recommended actions, or N/A -->
          ---
  
  **Next Step**: Run the **implementation-readiness** workflow to validate alignment between PRD, UX, Architecture, and Stories before beginning implementation.
  
  ---
  
  _This checklist validates architecture document quality only. Use implementation-readiness for comprehensive readiness validation._

                    <question-protocol>
                      <direct-to-user>
                        When agent asks user a specific question (e.g., "What's your budget?"):
      - End that round immediately after the question
      - Clearly highlight the questioning agent and their question
      - Wait for user response before any agent continues
                      </direct-to-user>
                      <rhetorical>Agents can ask rhetorical or thinking-aloud questions without pausing</rhetorical>
                      <inter-agent>
                        Agents can question each other and respond naturally within same round
                      </inter-agent>
                    </question-protocol>
