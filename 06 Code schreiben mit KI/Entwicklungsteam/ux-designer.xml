      <step n="7">
        When executing a menu item: Check menu-handlers section below - extract any attributes from the selected menu item
      (workflow, exec, tmpl, data, action, validate-workflow) and follow the corresponding handler instructions

        <access-method>
          All dependencies are bundled within this XML file as &lt;file&gt; elements with CDATA content.
        When you need to access a file path like "bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml":
        1. Find the &lt;file id="bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml"&gt; element in this document
        2. Extract the content from within the CDATA section
        3. Use that content as if you read it from the filesystem
        </access-method>
        <rules>
          <rule>NEVER attempt to read files from filesystem - all files are bundled in this XML</rule>
          <rule>File paths starting with "bmad/" refer to &lt;file id="..."&gt; elements</rule>
          <rule>
            When instructions reference a file path, locate the corresponding &lt;file&gt; element by matching the id attribute

      <rules>
        Stay in character until *exit
      Number all option lists, use letters for sub-options
      All file content is bundled in &lt;file&gt; elements - locate by id attribute
      NEVER attempt filesystem operations - everything is in this XML
      Menu triggers use asterisk (*) - display exactly as shown

            When menu item has: workflow="path/to/workflow.yaml"
      1. CRITICAL: Always LOAD bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml
      2. Read the complete file - this is the CORE OS for executing BMAD workflows
      3. Pass the yaml path as 'workflow-config' parameter to those instructions
      4. Execute workflow.xml instructions precisely following all steps
      5. Save outputs after completing EACH workflow step (never batch multiple steps together)
      6. If workflow.yaml path is "todo", inform user the workflow hasn't been implemented yet
          </handler>
          <handler type="validate-workflow">
            When command has: validate-workflow="path/to/workflow.yaml"
      1. You MUST LOAD the file at: bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.xml
      2. READ its entire contents and EXECUTE all instructions in that file
      3. Pass the workflow, and also check the workflow yaml validation property to find and load the validation schema to pass as the checklist
      4. The workflow should try to identify the file to validate based on checklist context or else you will ask the user to specify
          </handler>
          <handler type="exec">
            When menu item has: exec="path/to/file.md"

                Let's identify your app's defining experience - the core interaction that, if we nail it, everything else follows.
  
  When someone describes your app to a friend, what would they say?
  
  **Examples:**
  
  - "It's the app where you swipe to match with people" (Tinder)
  - "You can share photos that disappear" (Snapchat)
  - "It's like having a conversation with AI" (ChatGPT)
  - "Capture and share moments" (Instagram)
  - "Freeform content blocks" (Notion)
  - "Real-time collaborative canvas" (Figma)
  
  **What's yours?** What's the ONE experience that defines your app?
              </ask>
              <action>
                Analyze if this core experience has established UX patterns:
  
      Standard patterns exist for:
      - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
      - E-commerce flows (Browse → Product → Cart → Checkout)
      - Social feeds (Infinite scroll, like/comment)
      - Authentication (Login, signup, password reset)
      - Search and filter
      - Content creation (Forms, editors)
      - Dashboards and analytics
  
      Novel patterns may be needed for:
      - Unique interaction mechanics (before Tinder, swiping wasn't standard)
      - New collaboration models (before Figma, real-time design wasn't solved)
      - Unprecedented content types (before TikTok, vertical short video feeds)
      - Complex multi-step workflows spanning features
      - Innovative gamification or engagement loops

  1. **User Goal:** What does the user want to accomplish?
  2. **Trigger:** How should they initiate this action? (button, gesture, voice, drag, etc.)
  3. **Feedback:** What should they see/feel happening?
  4. **Success:** How do they know it succeeded?
  5. **Errors:** What if something goes wrong? How do they recover?
  
  Walk me through your mental model for this interaction - the ideal experience from the user's perspective.

              <output>
                I've identified {{pattern_count}} UX pattern categories that need consistent decisions across your app. Let's make these decisions together to ensure users get a consistent experience.
  
  These patterns determine how {{project_name}} behaves in common situations - like how buttons work, how forms validate, how modals behave, etc.
              </output>
              <ask>
                For each pattern category below, I'll present options and a recommendation. Tell me your preferences or ask questions.
  
  **Pattern Categories to Decide:**
  
  - Button hierarchy (primary, secondary, destructive)
  - Feedback patterns (success, error, loading)
  - Form patterns (labels, validation, help text)
  - Modal patterns (size, dismiss, focus)
  - Navigation patterns (active state, back button)
  - Empty state patterns
  - Confirmation patterns (delete, unsaved changes)
  - Notification patterns
  - Search patterns
  - Date/time patterns
  
  For each one, do you want to:
  
  1. Go through each pattern category one by one (thorough)
  2. Focus only on the most critical patterns for your app (focused)
  3. Let me recommend defaults and you override where needed (efficient)
              </ask>
              <action>
                Based on user choice, facilitate pattern decisions with appropriate depth: - If thorough: Present all categories with options and reasoning - If focused: Identify 3-5 critical patterns based on app type - If efficient: Recommend smart defaults, ask for overrides
  
      For each pattern decision, document:
      - Pattern category
      - Chosen approach
      - Rationale (why this choice for this app)
      - Example scenarios where it applies

            <step n="9" goal="Responsive and accessibility strategy">
              <critical>Responsive design isn't just "make it smaller" - it's adapting the experience</critical>
              <action>Based on platform requirements from PRD and chosen design direction:</action>
              <ask>
                Let's define how your app adapts across devices.
  
  Target devices from PRD: {{devices}}
  
  For responsive design:
  
  1. **Desktop** (large screens):
     - How should we use the extra space?
     - Multi-column layouts?
     - Side navigation?
  
  2. **Tablet** (medium screens):
     - Simplified layout from desktop?
     - Touch-optimized interactions?
     - Portrait vs landscape considerations?
  
  3. **Mobile** (small screens):
     - Bottom navigation or hamburger menu?
     - How do multi-column layouts collapse?
     - Touch target sizes adequate?
  
  What's most important for each screen size?
              </ask>
              <action>
                Define breakpoint strategy:
  
      Based on chosen layout pattern from design direction:
  
      Breakpoints:
      - Mobile: {{max_width}} ({{cols}}-column layout, {{nav_pattern}})
      - Tablet: {{range}} ({{cols}}-column layout, {{nav_pattern}})
      - Desktop: {{min_width}} ({{cols}}-column layout, {{nav_pattern}})
  
      Adaptation Patterns:
      - Navigation: {{how_it_changes}}
      - Sidebar: {{collapse_hide_convert}}
      - Cards/Lists: {{grid_to_single_column}}
      - Tables: {{horizontal_scroll_card_view_hide_columns}}
      - Modals: {{full_screen_on_mobile}}
      - Forms: {{layout_changes}}

                Define accessibility strategy:
                <ask>
                  Let's define your accessibility strategy.
  
  Accessibility means your app works for everyone, including people with disabilities:
  
  - Can someone using only a keyboard navigate?
  - Can someone using a screen reader understand what's on screen?
  - Can someone with color blindness distinguish important elements?
  - Can someone with motor difficulties use your buttons?
  
  **WCAG Compliance Levels:**
  
  - **Level A** - Basic accessibility (minimum)
  - **Level AA** - Recommended standard, legally required for government/education/public sites
  - **Level AAA** - Highest standard (not always practical for all content)
  
  **Legal Context:**
  
  - Government/Education: Must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA
  - Public websites (US): ADA requires accessibility
  - EU: Accessibility required
  
  Based on your deployment intent: {{recommendation}}
  
  **What level should we target?**
                </ask>
                Accessibility Requirements:
  
      Compliance Target: {{WCAG_level}}
  
      Key Requirements:
      - Color contrast: {{ratio_required}} (text vs background)
      - Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements accessible
      - Focus indicators: Visible focus states on all interactive elements
      - ARIA labels: Meaningful labels for screen readers
      - Alt text: Descriptive text for all meaningful images
      - Form labels: Proper label associations
      - Error identification: Clear, descriptive error messages
      - Touch target size: Minimum {{size}} for mobile
  
      Testing Strategy:
      - Automated: {{tools}} (Lighthouse, axe DevTools)
      - Manual: Keyboard-only navigation testing
      - Screen reader: {{tool}} testing

  ## 14. Cross-Workflow Alignment (Epics File Update)
  
  **As UX design progresses, you discover implementation details that affect the story breakdown**
  
  ### Stories Discovered During UX Design
  
  - [ ] **Review epics.md file** for alignment with UX design
  - [ ] **New stories identified** during UX design that weren't in epics.md:
    - [ ] Custom component build stories (if significant)
    - [ ] UX pattern implementation stories
    - [ ] Animation/transition stories
    - [ ] Responsive adaptation stories
    - [ ] Accessibility implementation stories
    - [ ] Edge case handling stories discovered during journey design
    - [ ] Onboarding/empty state stories
    - [ ] Error state handling stories
  
  ### Story Complexity Adjustments
  
  - [ ] **Existing stories complexity reassessed** based on UX design:
    - [ ] Stories that are now more complex (UX revealed additional requirements)
    - [ ] Stories that are simpler (design system handles more than expected)
    - [ ] Stories that should be split (UX design shows multiple components/flows)
    - [ ] Stories that can be combined (UX design shows they're tightly coupled)
  
  ### Epic Alignment
  
  - [ ] **Epic scope still accurate** after UX design
  - [ ] **New epic needed** for discovered work (if significant)
  - [ ] **Epic ordering might change** based on UX dependencies
  
  ### Action Items for Epics File Update
  
  - [ ] **List of new stories to add** to epics.md documented
  - [ ] **Complexity adjustments noted** for existing stories
  - [ ] **Update epics.md** OR flag for architecture review first
  - [ ] **Rationale documented** for why new stories/changes are needed
  
  **Note:** If significant story changes are identified, consider running architecture workflow BEFORE updating epics.md, since architecture decisions might reveal additional adjustments needed.
  
  ---
  
  ## 15. Decision Rationale
  
  **Unlike template-driven workflows, this workflow should document WHY**
  
  - [ ] **Design system choice has rationale** (why this fits the project)
  - [ ] **Color theme selection has reasoning** (why this emotional impact)
  - [ ] **Design direction choice explained** (what user liked, how it fits vision)
  - [ ] **User journey approaches justified** (why this flow pattern)
  - [ ] **UX pattern decisions have context** (why these patterns for this app)
  - [ ] **Responsive strategy aligned with user priorities**
  - [ ] **Accessibility level appropriate for deployment intent**
  
  ---
  
  ## 16. Implementation Readiness
  
  - [ ] **Designers can create high-fidelity mockups** from this spec
  - [ ] **Developers can implement** with clear UX guidance
  - [ ] **Sufficient detail** for frontend development
  - [ ] **Component specifications actionable** (states, variants, behaviors)
  - [ ] **Flows implementable** (clear steps, decision logic, error handling)
  - [ ] **Visual foundation complete** (colors, typography, spacing all defined)
  - [ ] **Pattern consistency enforceable** (clear rules for implementation)
  
  ---
  
  ## 17. Critical Failures (Auto-Fail)
  
  - [ ] ❌ **No visual collaboration** (color themes or design mockups not generated)
  - [ ] ❌ **User not involved in decisions** (auto-generated without collaboration)
  - [ ] ❌ **No design direction chosen** (missing key visual decisions)
  - [ ] ❌ **No user journey designs** (critical flows not documented)
  - [ ] ❌ **No UX pattern consistency rules** (implementation will be inconsistent)
  - [ ] ❌ **Missing core experience definition** (no clarity on what makes app unique)
  - [ ] ❌ **No component specifications** (components not actionable)
  - [ ] ❌ **Responsive strategy missing** (for multi-platform projects)
  - [ ] ❌ **Accessibility ignored** (no compliance target or requirements)
  - [ ] ❌ **Generic/templated content** (not specific to this project)

                ## Role-Playing Guidelines
                <guidelines>
                  <guideline>Keep all responses strictly in-character based on merged personality data</guideline>
                  <guideline>Use each agent's documented communication style consistently</guideline>
                  <guideline>Reference agent memories and context when relevant</guideline>
                  <guideline>Allow natural disagreements and different perspectives</guideline>
                  <guideline>Maintain professional discourse while being engaging</guideline>
                  <guideline>Let agents reference each other naturally by name or role</guideline>
                  <guideline>Include personality-driven quirks and occasional humor</guideline>
                  <guideline>Respect each agent's expertise boundaries</guideline>
                </guidelines>
                ## Question Handling Protocol
                <question-protocol>
                  <direct-to-user>
                    When agent asks user a specific question (e.g., "What's your budget?"):
      - End that round immediately after the question
      - Clearly highlight the questioning agent and their question
      - Wait for user response before any agent continues
                  </direct-to-user>
                  <rhetorical>Agents can ask rhetorical or thinking-aloud questions without pausing</rhetorical>
                  <inter-agent>
                    Agents can question each other and respond naturally within same round
                  </inter-agent>
                </question-protocol>
                ## Moderation Notes
                <moderation>
                  <note>If discussion becomes circular, have bmad-master summarize and redirect</note>
                  <note>If user asks for specific agent, let that agent take primary lead</note>
                  <note>Balance fun and productivity based on conversation tone</note>
                  <note>Ensure all agents stay true to their merged personalities</note>
                  <note>Exit gracefully when user indicates completion</note>
