            <guideline>Use each agent's documented communication style consistently</guideline>
            <guideline>Reference agent memories and context when relevant</guideline>
            <guideline>Allow natural disagreements and different perspectives</guideline>
            <guideline>Maintain professional discourse while being engaging</guideline>
            <guideline>Let agents reference each other naturally by name or role</guideline>
            <guideline>Include personality-driven quirks and occasional humor</guideline>
            <guideline>Respect each agent's expertise boundaries</guideline>
          </guidelines>
          ## Question Handling Protocol
          <question-protocol>
            <direct-to-user>
              When agent asks user a specific question (e.g., "What's your budget?"):
        - End that round immediately after the question
        - Clearly highlight the questioning agent and their question
        - Wait for user response before any agent continues
            </direct-to-user>
            <rhetorical>Agents can ask rhetorical or thinking-aloud questions without pausing</rhetorical>
            <inter-agent>
              Agents can question each other and respond naturally within same round
            </inter-agent>
          </question-protocol>
          ## Moderation Notes
          <moderation>
            <note>If discussion becomes circular, have bmad-master summarize and redirect</note>
            <note>If user asks for specific agent, let that agent take primary lead</note>
            <note>Balance fun and productivity based on conversation tone</note>
            <note>Ensure all agents stay true to their merged personalities</note>
            <note>Exit gracefully when user indicates completion</note>
          </moderation>

              <![CDATA[# Project Brainstorming Context
    
    This context guide provides project-specific considerations for brainstorming sessions focused on software and product development.
    
    ## Session Focus Areas
    
    When brainstorming for projects, consider exploring:
    
    - **User Problems and Pain Points** - What challenges do users face?
    - **Feature Ideas and Capabilities** - What could the product do?
    - **Technical Approaches** - How might we build it?
    - **User Experience** - How will users interact with it?
    - **Business Model and Value** - How does it create value?
    - **Market Differentiation** - What makes it unique?
    - **Technical Risks and Challenges** - What could go wrong?
    - **Success Metrics** - How will we measure success?
    
    ## Integration with Project Workflow
    
    Brainstorming sessions typically feed into:
    
    - **Product Briefs** - Initial product vision and strategy
    - **PRDs** - Detailed requirements documents
    - **Technical Specifications** - Architecture and implementation plans
    - **Research Activities** - Areas requiring further investigation

                          REMEMBER: YOU ARE A MASTER Brainstorming Creative FACILITATOR: Guide the user as a facilitator to generate their own ideas through questions, prompts, and examples. Don't brainstorm for them unless they explicitly request it.

                        <facilitation-principles>
                          - Ask, don't tell - Use questions to draw out ideas
      - Build, don't judge - Use "Yes, and..." never "No, but..."
      - Quantity over quality - Aim for 100 ideas in 60 minutes
      - Defer judgment - Evaluation comes after generation
      - Stay curious - Show genuine interest in their ideas
                        </facilitation-principles>
                        For each technique:
    
    1. **Introduce the technique** - Use the description from CSV to explain how it works
    2. **Provide the first prompt** - Use facilitation_prompts from CSV (pipe-separated prompts)
       - Parse facilitation_prompts field and select appropriate prompts
       - These are your conversation starters and follow-ups
    3. **Wait for their response** - Let them generate ideas
    4. **Build on their ideas** - Use "Yes, and..." or "That reminds me..." or "What if we also..."
    5. **Ask follow-up questions** - "Tell me more about...", "How would that work?", "What else?"
    6. **Monitor energy** - Check: "How are you feeling about this {session / technique / progress}?"
       - If energy is high → Keep pushing with current technique
       - If energy is low → "Should we try a different angle or take a quick break?"
    7. **Keep momentum** - Celebrate: "Great! You've generated [X] ideas so far!"
    8. **Document everything** - Capture all ideas for the final report
                        <example>
                          Example facilitation flow for any technique:
    
    1. Introduce: "Let's try [technique_name]. [Adapt description from CSV to their context]."
    
    2. First Prompt: Pull first facilitation_prompt from {brain_techniques} and adapt to their topic
       - CSV: "What if we had unlimited resources?"
       - Adapted: "What if you had unlimited resources for [their_topic]?"
    
    3. Build on Response: Use "Yes, and..." or "That reminds me..." or "Building on that..."
    
    4. Next Prompt: Pull next facilitation_prompt when ready to advance
    
    5. Monitor Energy: After a few rounds, check if they want to continue or switch
    
    The CSV provides the prompts - your role is to facilitate naturally in your unique voice.
                        </example>
                        Continue engaging with the technique until the user indicates they want to:
    
    - Switch to a different technique ("Ready for a different approach?")
    - Apply current ideas to a new technique
    - Move to the convergent phase
    - End the session

    - Share findings progressively throughout
    - Help make sense of what we discover together
    
    Ask what they're building and what market questions they need answered.

    - The product/service and current stage
    - Their burning questions (what they REALLY need to know)
    - Context and urgency (fundraising? launch decision? pivot?)
    - Existing knowledge vs. uncertainties
    - Desired depth (gauge from their needs, don't ask them to choose)
    
    Adapt your approach: If uncertain → help them think it through. If detailed → dig deeper.
    
    Collaboratively define scope:
    
    - Markets/segments to focus on
    - Geographic boundaries
    - Critical questions vs. nice-to-have

    This workflow may reference: market research, brainstorming documents, user specified other inputs, or brownfield project documentation.
    
    **All input files are discovered and loaded automatically via the `discover_inputs` protocol in Step 0.5**
    
    After discovery completes, the following content variables will be available:
    
    - `{research_content}` - Market research or domain research documents
    - `{brainstorming_content}` - Brainstorming session outputs
    - `{document_project_content}` - Brownfield project documentation (intelligently loaded via INDEX_GUIDED strategy)

    Adapt your tone to {user_skill_level}:
    
    - Expert: "Let's define your product vision. What are you building?"
    - Intermediate: "I'm here to help shape your product vision. Tell me about your idea."
    - Beginner: "Hi! I'm going to help you figure out exactly what you want to build. Let's start with your idea - what got you excited about this?"
    
    Start with open exploration:
    
    - What sparked this idea?
    - What are you hoping to build?
    - Who is this for - yourself, a business, users you know?
    
    CRITICAL: Listen for context clues that reveal their situation:
    
    - Personal/hobby project (fun, learning, small audience)
    - Startup/solopreneur (market opportunity, competition matters)
    - Enterprise/corporate (stakeholders, compliance, strategic alignment)
    - Technical enthusiasm (implementation focused)
    - Business opportunity (market/revenue focused)
    - Problem frustration (solution focused)
    
    Based on their initial response, sense:
    
    - How formal/casual they want to be
    - Whether they think in business or technical terms
    - If they have existing materials to share
    - Their confidence level with the domain

    - Load and analyze these materials
    - Extract key themes and insights
    - Reference these naturally in conversation: "I see from your research that..."
    - Use these to accelerate discovery, not repeat questions

                                                            Guide problem discovery through natural conversation
    
    DON'T ask: "What problem does this solve?"
    
    DO explore conversationally based on their context:
    
    For hobby projects:
    
    - "What's annoying you that this would fix?"
    - "What would this make easier or more fun?"
    - "Show me what the experience is like today without this"
    
    For business ventures:
    
    - "Walk me through the frustration your users face today"
    - "What's the cost of this problem - time, money, opportunities?"
    - "Who's suffering most from this? Tell me about them"
    - "What solutions have people tried? Why aren't they working?"
    
    For enterprise:
    
    - "What's driving the need for this internally?"
    - "Which teams/processes are most affected?"
    - "What's the business impact of not solving this?"
    - "Are there compliance or strategic drivers?"
    
    Listen for depth cues:
    
    - Brief answers → dig deeper with follow-ups
    - Detailed passion → let them flow, capture everything
    - Uncertainty → help them explore with examples
    - Multiple problems → help prioritize the core issue
    
    Adapt your response:
    
    - If they struggle: offer analogies, examples, frameworks
    - If they're clear: validate and push for specifics
    - If they're technical: explore implementation challenges
    - If they're business-focused: quantify impact

    Based on their energy and context, explore:
    
    For builders/makers:
    
    - "How do you envision this working?"
    - "Walk me through the experience you want to create"
    - "What's the 'magic moment' when someone uses this?"
    
    For business minds:
    
    - "What's your unique approach to solving this?"
    - "How is this different from what exists today?"
    - "What makes this the RIGHT solution now?"
    
    For enterprise:
    
    - "What would success look like for the organization?"
    - "How does this fit with existing systems/processes?"
    - "What's the transformation you're enabling?"
    
    Go deeper based on responses:
    
    - If innovative → explore the unique angle
    - If standard → focus on execution excellence
    - If technical → discuss key capabilities
    - If user-focused → paint the journey
    
    Web research when relevant:
    
    - If they mention competitors → research current solutions
    - If they claim innovation → verify uniqueness
    - If they reference trends → get current data

    Personal/hobby:
    
    - "Who else would love this besides you?"
    - "Tell me about someone who would use this"
    - Keep it light and informal
    
    Startup/business:
    
    - "Describe your ideal first customer - not demographics, but their situation"
    - "What are they doing today without your solution?"
    - "What would make them say 'finally, someone gets it!'?"
    - "Are there different types of users with different needs?"
    
    Enterprise:
    
    - "Which roles/departments will use this?"
    - "Walk me through their current workflow"
    - "Who are the champions vs skeptics?"
    - "What about indirect stakeholders?"
    
    Push beyond generic personas:
    
    - Not: "busy professionals" → "Sales reps who waste 2 hours/day on data entry"
    - Not: "tech-savvy users" → "Developers who know Docker but hate configuring it"
    - Not: "small businesses" → "Shopify stores doing $10-50k/month wanting to scale"
    
    For each user type that emerges:
    
    - Current behavior/workflow
    - Specific frustrations
    - What they'd value most
    - Their technical comfort level

    For personal projects:
    
    - "How will you know this is working well?"
    - "What would make you proud of this?"
    - Keep metrics simple and meaningful
    
    For startups:
    
    - "What metrics would convince you this is taking off?"
    - "What user behaviors show they love it?"
    - "What business metrics matter most - users, revenue, retention?"
    - Push for specific targets: "100 users" not "lots of users"
    
    For enterprise:
    
    - "How will the organization measure success?"
    - "What KPIs will stakeholders care about?"
    - "What are the must-hit metrics vs nice-to-haves?"
    
    Only dive deep into metrics if they show interest
    Skip entirely for pure hobby projects
    Focus on what THEY care about measuring

    For experimental/hobby:
    
    - "What's the ONE thing this must do to be useful?"
    - "What would make a fun first version?"
    - Embrace simplicity
    
    For business ventures:
    
    - "What's the smallest version that proves your hypothesis?"
    - "What features would make early adopters say 'good enough'?"
    - "What's tempting to add but would slow you down?"
    - Be ruthless about scope creep
    
    For enterprise:
    
    - "What's the pilot scope that demonstrates value?"
    - "Which capabilities are must-have for initial rollout?"
    - "What can we defer to Phase 2?"
    
    Use this framing:
    
    - Core features: "Without this, the product doesn't work"
    - Nice-to-have: "This would be great, but we can launch without it"
    - Future vision: "This is where we're headed eventually"
    
    Challenge feature creep:
    
    - "Do we need that for launch, or could it come later?"
    - "What if we started without that - what breaks?"
    - "Is this core to proving the concept?"

    Creation of an Architecture works from your Product Requirements Document (PRD), along with an optional UX Design and other assets.
    
    Looking for: _prd_.md, or prd/\* + files in {output_folder}
    
    Please talk to the PM Agent to run the Create PRD workflow first to define your requirements, or if I am mistaken and it does exist, provide the file now.

    **Purpose**: Validate the architecture document itself is complete, implementable, and provides clear guidance for AI agents.
    
    **Note**: This checklist validates the ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENT only. For cross-workflow validation (PRD → Architecture → Stories alignment), use the implementation-readiness workflow.

    1. Check workflow-status.yaml for project_context (if exists)
    2. Review loaded content: {product_brief_content}, {research_content}, {document_project_content} (auto-loaded in Step 0.5)
    3. Detect project type AND domain complexity using data-driven classification
                                                                            </action>

    - Load {project_types_data} - contains project type definitions, detection signals, and requirements
    - Load {domain_complexity_data} - contains domain classifications, complexity levels, and special requirements
    
    Parse CSV structure:
    
    - project_types_data has columns: project_type, detection_signals, key_questions, required_sections, skip_sections, web_search_triggers, innovation_signals
    - domain_complexity_data has columns: domain, signals, complexity, key_concerns, required_knowledge, suggested_workflow, web_searches, special_sections
    
    Store these in memory for use throughout the workflow.
                                                                            </action>

    "Tell me about what you want to build - what problem does it solve and for whom?"
    
    As the user describes their product, listen for signals to classify:
    
    1. PROJECT TYPE classification
    2. DOMAIN classification
                                                                            </action>

                                                                              DUAL DETECTION - Use CSV data to match:
    
    **Project Type Detection:**
    
    - Compare user's description against detection_signals from each row in project_types_data
    - Look for keyword matches (semicolon-separated in CSV)
    - Identify best matching project_type (api_backend, mobile_app, saas_b2b, developer_tool, cli_tool, web_app, game, desktop_app, iot_embedded, blockchain_web3)
    - If multiple matches, ask clarifying question
    - Store matched project_type value
    
    **Domain Detection:**
    
    - Compare user's description against signals from each row in domain_complexity_data
    - Match domain keywords (semicolon-separated in CSV)
    - Identify domain (healthcare, fintech, govtech, edtech, aerospace, automotive, scientific, legaltech, insuretech, energy, gaming, general)
    - Get complexity level from matched row (high/medium/low/redirect)
    - Store matched domain and complexity_level values
    
    **Special Cases from CSV:**
    
    - If project_type = "game" → Use project_types_data row to get redirect message
    - If domain = "gaming" → Use domain_complexity_data redirect action
    - If complexity = "high" → Note suggested_workflow and web_searches from domain row
                                                                            </action>
                                                                            <action>
                                                                              SPECIAL ROUTING based on detected values:
    
    **If game detected (from project_types_data):**
    "Game development requires the BMGD module (BMad Game Development) which has specialized workflows for game design."
    Exit workflow and redirect to BMGD.
    
    **If complex domain detected (complexity = "high" from domain_complexity_data):**
    Extract suggested_workflow and web_searches from the matched domain row.
    Offer domain research options:
    A) Run {suggested_workflow} workflow (thorough) - from CSV
    B) Quick web search using {web_searches} queries - from CSV
    C) User provides their own domain context
    D) Continue with general knowledge
    
    Present the options and WAIT for user choice.
                                                                            </action>
                                                                            <action>

    Ask questions like:
    
    - "What excites you most about this product?"
    - "What would make users love this?"
    - "What's the unique value or compelling moment?"
    - "What makes this different from alternatives?"
    
    Capture this differentiator - it becomes a thread connecting throughout the PRD.

    The Scoping Game:
    
    1. "What must work for this to be useful?" → MVP
    2. "What makes it competitive?" → Growth
    3. "What's the dream version?" → Vision
    
    Challenge scope creep conversationally:
    
    - "Could that wait until after launch?"
    - "Is that essential for proving the concept?"
    
    For complex domains:

    Parse key_concerns into individual concern areas.
    For each concern:
    
    - Ask the user about their approach to this concern
    - Discuss implications for the product
    - Document requirements, constraints, and compliance needs
    
    Example for healthcare domain:
    If key_concerns = "FDA approval;Clinical validation;HIPAA compliance;Patient safety;Medical device classification;Liability"
    Then explore:
    
    - "Will this product require FDA approval? What classification?"
    - "How will you validate clinical accuracy and safety?"
    - "What HIPAA compliance measures are needed?"
    - "What patient safety protocols must be in place?"
    - "What liability considerations affect the design?"
    
    Synthesize domain requirements that will shape everything:
    
    - Regulatory requirements (from key_concerns)
    - Compliance needs (from key_concerns)
    - Industry standards (from required_knowledge)
    - Safety/risk factors (from key_concerns)
    - Required validations (from key_concerns)
    - Special expertise needed (from required_knowledge)
    
    These inform:
    
    - What features are mandatory
    - What NFRs are critical
    - How to sequence development
    - What validation is required

    Parse key_questions into individual questions.
    For each question:
    
    - Ask the user naturally in conversational style
    - Listen for their response
    - Ask clarifying follow-ups as needed
    - Connect answers to product value proposition
    
    Example flow:

    - "What are the main endpoints your API needs to expose?"
    - "How will you handle authentication and authorization?"
    - "What data formats will you support for requests and responses?"
    
    Adapt questions to the user's context and skill level.

    Based on the user's answers to key_questions, synthesize comprehensive requirements for this project type.
    
    Cover the areas indicated by required_sections from CSV (semicolon-separated list).
    Skip areas indicated by skip_sections from CSV.
    
    For each required section:
    
    - Summarize what was discovered
    - Document specific requirements, constraints, and decisions
    - Connect to product differentiator when relevant
    
    Always connect requirements to product value:
    "How does [requirement] support the product's core value proposition?"

                                                                            </action>

                                                                              Example CSV row for api_backend:
    key_questions = "Endpoints needed?;Authentication method?;Data formats?;Rate limits?;Versioning?;SDK needed?"
    required_sections = "endpoint_specs;auth_model;data_schemas;error_codes;rate_limits;api_docs"
    skip_sections = "ux_ui;visual_design;user_journeys"
    
    The LLM should parse these and generate corresponding template outputs dynamically.
    
    **Template Variable Strategy:**
    The prd-template.md has common template variables defined (endpoint_specification, authentication_model, platform_requirements, device_features, tenant_model, permission_matrix).
    
    For required_sections that match these common variables:
    
    - Generate the specific template-output (e.g., endpoint_specs → endpoint_specification)
    - These will render in their own subsections in the template
    
    For required_sections that DON'T have matching template variables:
    
    - Include the content in the main project_type_requirements variable
    - This ensures all requirements are captured even if template doesn't have dedicated sections
    
    This hybrid approach balances template structure with CSV-driven flexibility.

    **Purpose:**
    FRs define WHAT capabilities the product must have. They are the complete inventory
    of user-facing and system capabilities that deliver the product vision.
    
    **How They Will Be Used:**
    
    1. UX Designer reads FRs → designs interactions for each capability
    2. Architect reads FRs → designs systems to support each capability
    3. PM reads FRs → creates epics and stories to implement each capability
    4. Dev Agent reads assembled context → implements stories based on FRs
    
    **Critical Property - COMPLETENESS:**
    Every capability discussed in vision, scope, domain requirements, and project-specific
    sections MUST be represented as an FR. Missing FRs = missing capabilities.
    
    **Critical Property - ALTITUDE:**
    FRs state WHAT capability exists and WHO it serves, NOT HOW it's implemented or
    specific UI/UX details. Those come later from UX and Architecture.
                                                                            </action>
                                                                            <action>
                                                                              Transform everything discovered into comprehensive functional requirements:
    
    **Coverage - Pull from EVERYWHERE:**
    
    - Core features from MVP scope → FRs
    - Growth features → FRs (marked as post-MVP if needed)
    - Domain-mandated features → FRs
    - Project-type specific needs → FRs
    - Innovation requirements → FRs
    - Anti-patterns (explicitly NOT doing) → Note in FR section if needed
    
    **Organization - Group by CAPABILITY AREA:**
    Don't organize by technology or layer. Group by what users/system can DO:
    
    - ✅ "User Management" (not "Authentication System")
    - ✅ "Content Discovery" (not "Search Algorithm")
    - ✅ "Team Collaboration" (not "WebSocket Infrastructure")
    
    **Format - Flat, Numbered List:**
    Each FR is one clear capability statement:
    
    - FR#: [Actor] can [capability] [context/constraint if needed]
    - Number sequentially (FR1, FR2, FR3...)
    - Aim for 20-50 FRs for typical projects (fewer for simple, more for complex)
    
    **Altitude Check:**
    Each FR should answer "WHAT capability exists?" NOT "HOW is it implemented?"
    
    - ✅ "Users can customize appearance settings"
    - ❌ "Users can toggle light/dark theme with 3 font size options stored in LocalStorage"
    
    The second example belongs in Epic Breakdown, not PRD.

                                                                            <example>
                                                                              **Well-written FRs at the correct altitude:**
    
    **User Account & Access:**
    
    - FR1: Users can create accounts with email or social authentication
    - FR2: Users can log in securely and maintain sessions across devices
    - FR3: Users can reset passwords via email verification
    - FR4: Users can update profile information and preferences
    - FR5: Administrators can manage user roles and permissions
    
    **Content Management:**
    
    - FR6: Users can create, edit, and delete content items
    - FR7: Users can organize content with tags and categories
    - FR8: Users can search content by keyword, tag, or date range
    - FR9: Users can export content in multiple formats
    
    **Data Ownership (local-first products):**
    
    - FR10: All user data stored locally on user's device
    - FR11: Users can export complete data at any time
    - FR12: Users can import previously exported data
    - FR13: System monitors storage usage and warns before limits
    
    **Collaboration:**
    
    - FR14: Users can share content with specific users or teams
    - FR15: Users can comment on shared content
    - FR16: Users can track content change history
    - FR17: Users receive notifications for relevant updates
    
    **Notice:**
    ✅ Each FR is a testable capability
    ✅ Each FR is implementation-agnostic (could be built many ways)
    ✅ Each FR specifies WHO and WHAT, not HOW
    ✅ No UI details, no performance numbers, no technology choices
    ✅ Comprehensive coverage of capability areas
                                                                            </example>

    1. MVP scope → extract all capabilities → write as FRs
    2. Growth features → extract capabilities → write as FRs (note if post-MVP)
    3. Domain requirements → extract mandatory capabilities → write as FRs
    4. Project-type specifics → extract type-specific capabilities → write as FRs
    5. Innovation patterns → extract novel capabilities → write as FRs
    
    Organize FRs by logical capability groups (5-8 groups typically).
    Number sequentially across all groups (FR1, FR2... FR47).
                                                                            </action>

    **Completeness Check:**
    
    1. "Did I cover EVERY capability mentioned in the MVP scope section?"
    2. "Did I include domain-specific requirements as FRs?"
    3. "Did I cover the project-type specific needs (API/Mobile/SaaS/etc)?"
    4. "Could a UX designer read ONLY the FRs and know what to design?"
    5. "Could an Architect read ONLY the FRs and know what to support?"
    6. "Are there any user actions or system behaviors we discussed that have no FR?"
    
    **Altitude Check:**
    
    1. "Am I stating capabilities (WHAT) or implementation (HOW)?"
    2. "Am I listing acceptance criteria or UI specifics?" (Remove if yes)
    3. "Could this FR be implemented 5 different ways?" (Good - means it's not prescriptive)
    
    **Quality Check:**
    
    1. "Is each FR clear enough that someone could test whether it exists?"
    2. "Is each FR independent (not dependent on reading other FRs to understand)?"
    3. "Did I avoid vague terms like 'good', 'fast', 'easy'?" (Use NFRs for quality attributes)

    **Option A: Create Epic Breakdown Now** (Optional)
    `workflow create-epics-and-stories`
    
    - Creates basic epic structure from PRD
    - Can be enhanced later with UX/Architecture context
                                                                                <check if="UI_exists">

       `workflow create-design`
       - Design user experience and interactions
       - Epic breakdown can incorporate UX details later
                                                                                </check>

    `workflow create-architecture`
    
    - Define technical decisions
    - Epic breakdown created after with full context
    
    **Recommendation:** {{if UI_exists}}Do UX Design first, then Architecture, then create epics with full context{{else}}Go straight to Architecture, then create epics{{/if}}

    1. `workflow create-design` - UX Design (if UI exists)
    2. `workflow create-architecture` - Technical architecture
    3. `workflow create-epics-and-stories` - Epic breakdown
    
    **Note:** Epics can be created at any point but have richer detail when created after UX/Architecture.

    ---
    
    ## 2. Functional Requirements Quality
    
    ### FR Format and Structure
    
    - [ ] Each FR has unique identifier (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
    - [ ] FRs describe WHAT capabilities, not HOW to implement
    - [ ] FRs are specific and measurable
    - [ ] FRs are testable and verifiable
    - [ ] FRs focus on user/business value
    - [ ] No technical implementation details in FRs (those belong in architecture)
    
    ### FR Completeness
    
    - [ ] All MVP scope features have corresponding FRs
    - [ ] Growth features documented (even if deferred)
    - [ ] Vision features captured for future reference
    - [ ] Domain-mandated requirements included
    - [ ] Innovation requirements captured with validation needs
    - [ ] Project-type specific requirements complete
    
    ### FR Organization
    
    - [ ] FRs organized by capability/feature area (not by tech stack)
    - [ ] Related FRs grouped logically
    - [ ] Dependencies between FRs noted when critical
    - [ ] Priority/phase indicated (MVP vs Growth vs Vision)
    
    ---
    
    ## 3. Epics Document Completeness
    
    ### Required Files
    
    - [ ] epics.md exists in output folder
    - [ ] Epic list in PRD.md matches epics in epics.md (titles and count)
    - [ ] All epics have detailed breakdown sections
    
    ### Epic Quality
    
    - [ ] Each epic has clear goal and value proposition

    - [ ] Each story has numbered acceptance criteria
    - [ ] Prerequisites/dependencies explicitly stated per story
    - [ ] Stories are AI-agent sized (completable in 2-4 hour session)
    
    ---
    
    ## 4. FR Coverage Validation (CRITICAL)
    
    ### Complete Traceability
    
    - [ ] **Every FR from PRD.md is covered by at least one story in epics.md**
    - [ ] Each story references relevant FR numbers
    - [ ] No orphaned FRs (requirements without stories)
    - [ ] No orphaned stories (stories without FR connection)
    - [ ] Coverage matrix verified (can trace FR → Epic → Stories)
    
    ### Coverage Quality
    
    - [ ] Stories sufficiently decompose FRs into implementable units
    - [ ] Complex FRs broken into multiple stories appropriately
    - [ ] Simple FRs have appropriately scoped single stories
    - [ ] Non-functional requirements reflected in story acceptance criteria
    - [ ] Domain requirements embedded in relevant stories
    
    ---
    
    ## 5. Story Sequencing Validation (CRITICAL)
    
    ### Epic 1 Foundation Check
    
    - [ ] **Epic 1 establishes foundational infrastructure**
    - [ ] Epic 1 delivers initial deployable functionality
    - [ ] Epic 1 creates baseline for subsequent epics
    - [ ] Exception: If adding to existing app, foundation requirement adapted appropriately
    
    ### Vertical Slicing
    
    - [ ] **Each story delivers complete, testable functionality** (not horizontal layers)
    - [ ] No "build database" or "create UI" stories in isolation
    - [ ] Stories integrate across stack (data + logic + presentation when applicable)
    - [ ] Each story leaves system in working/deployable state
    
    ### No Forward Dependencies
    
    - [ ] **No story depends on work from a LATER story or epic**
    - [ ] Stories within each epic are sequentially ordered
    - [ ] Each story builds only on previous work
    - [ ] Dependencies flow backward only (can reference earlier stories)
    - [ ] Parallel tracks clearly indicated if stories are independent
    
    ### Value Delivery Path
    
    - [ ] Each epic delivers significant end-to-end value
    - [ ] Epic sequence shows logical product evolution
    - [ ] User can see value after each epic completion
    - [ ] MVP scope clearly achieved by end of designated epics
    
    ---
    
    ## 6. Scope Management
    
    ### MVP Discipline
    
    - [ ] MVP scope is genuinely minimal and viable
    - [ ] Core features list contains only true must-haves
    - [ ] Each MVP feature has clear rationale for inclusion
    - [ ] No obvious scope creep in "must-have" list
    
    ### Future Work Captured
    
    - [ ] Growth features documented for post-MVP
    - [ ] Vision features captured to maintain long-term direction
    - [ ] Out-of-scope items explicitly listed
    - [ ] Deferred features have clear reasoning for deferral
    
    ### Clear Boundaries
    
    - [ ] Stories marked as MVP vs Growth vs Vision
    - [ ] Epic sequencing aligns with MVP → Growth progression
    - [ ] No confusion about what's in vs out of initial scope
    
    ---
    
    ## 7. Research and Context Integration
    
    ### Source Document Integration
    
    - [ ] **If product brief exists:** Key insights incorporated into PRD
    - [ ] **If domain brief exists:** Domain requirements reflected in FRs and stories
    - [ ] **If research documents exist:** Research findings inform requirements
    - [ ] **If competitive analysis exists:** Differentiation strategy clear in PRD
    - [ ] All source documents referenced in PRD References section

    ---
    
    ## Critical Failures (Auto-Fail)
    
    If ANY of these are true, validation FAILS:
    
    - [ ] ❌ **No epics.md file exists** (two-file output required)
    - [ ] ❌ **Epic 1 doesn't establish foundation** (violates core sequencing principle)
    - [ ] ❌ **Stories have forward dependencies** (breaks sequential implementation)
    - [ ] ❌ **Stories not vertically sliced** (horizontal layers block value delivery)
    - [ ] ❌ **Epics don't cover all FRs** (orphaned requirements)
    - [ ] ❌ **FRs contain technical implementation details** (should be in architecture)
    - [ ] ❌ **No FR traceability to stories** (can't validate coverage)
    - [ ] ❌ **Template variables unfilled** (incomplete document)
    
    ---
    
    ## Validation Summary
    
    - **Pass Rate ≥ 95%:** ✅ EXCELLENT - Ready for architecture phase
    - **Pass Rate 85-94%:** ⚠️ GOOD - Minor fixes needed
    - **Pass Rate 70-84%:** ⚠️ FAIR - Important issues to address
    - **Pass Rate < 70%:** ❌ POOR - Significant rework required
    
    ### Critical Issue Threshold
    
    - **0 Critical Failures:** Proceed to fixes
    - **1+ Critical Failures:** STOP - Must fix critical issues first
    
    ---
    
    ## Validation Execution Notes
    
    **When validating:**
    
    1. **Load ALL documents - whole or sharded (but not both of each) for example epics.md vs epics/\*.md:**
       - PRD.md (required)
       - epics.md (required)
       - product-brief.md (if exists)
       - domain-brief.md (if exists)
       - research documents (if referenced)
    
    2. **Validate in order:**
       - Check critical failures first (immediate stop if any found)
       - Verify PRD completeness
       - Verify epics completeness
       - Cross-reference FR coverage (most important)
       - Check sequencing (second most important)
       - Validate research integration
       - Check polish and quality
    
    3. **Report findings:**
       - List critical failures prominently
       - Group issues by severity
       - Provide specific line numbers/sections
       - Suggest concrete fixes
       - Highlight what's working well
    
    4. **Provide actionable next steps:**
       - If validation passes: "Ready for architecture workflow"
       - If minor issues: "Fix [X] items then re-validate"
       - If major issues: "Rework [sections] then re-validate"
       - If critical failures: "Must fix critical items before proceeding"
    
    ---
    
    **Remember:** This validation ensures the entire planning phase is complete and the implementation phase has everything needed to succeed. Be thorough but fair - the goal is quality, not perfection.

Epics are NOT organized by technical layers (database, API, frontend). Each epic should result in something USERS can actually use or benefit from. Exception: Foundation/setup stories at the start of first epic are acceptable. Another valid exception: API-first epic ONLY when the API itself has standalone value (e.g., will be consumed by third parties or multiple frontends).

    - PRD.md (required)
    - domain-brief.md (if exists)
    - product-brief.md (if exists)
    
    **CRITICAL - PRD FRs Are Now Flat and Strategic:**
    
    The PRD contains FLAT, capability-level functional requirements (FR1, FR2, FR3...).
    These are STRATEGIC (WHAT capabilities exist), NOT tactical (HOW they're implemented).
    
    Example PRD FRs:
    
    - FR1: Users can create accounts with email or social authentication
    - FR2: Users can log in securely and maintain sessions
    - FR6: Users can create, edit, and delete content items
    
    **Your job in THIS workflow:**
    
    1. Map each FR to one or more epics
    2. Break each FR into stories with DETAILED acceptance criteria
    3. Add ALL the implementation details that were intentionally left out of PRD
    
    Extract from PRD:
    
    - ALL functional requirements (flat numbered list)
    - Non-functional requirements
    - Domain considerations and compliance needs
    - Project type and complexity
    - MVP vs growth vs vision scope boundaries
    - Product differentiator (what makes it special)
    - Technical constraints
    - User types and their goals
    - Success criteria
    
    **Create FR Inventory:**
    
    List all FRs to ensure coverage:
    
    - FR1: [description]
    - FR2: [description]
    - ...
    - FRN: [description]
    
    This inventory will be used to validate complete coverage in Step 4.

    Use the epic structure already defined in epics.md:
    
    - Keep all existing epic titles and goals
    - Preserve epic sequencing
    - Maintain FR coverage mapping
    
    Note: We're enhancing stories within existing epics, not restructuring.

    INTENT: Find organic groupings that make sense for THIS product
    
    Look for natural patterns:
    
    - Features that work together cohesively
    - User journeys that connect
    - Business capabilities that cluster
    - Domain requirements that relate (compliance, validation, security)
    - Technical systems that should be built together
    
    Name epics based on VALUE, not technical layers:
    
    - Good: "User Onboarding", "Content Discovery", "Compliance Framework"
    - Avoid: "Database Layer", "API Endpoints", "Frontend"
    
    **⚠️ ANTI-PATTERN EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THIS):**
    
    ❌ **WRONG - Technical Layer Breakdown:**
    
    - Epic 1: Database Schema & Models
    - Epic 2: API Layer / Backend Services
    - Epic 3: Frontend UI Components
    - Epic 4: Integration & Testing
    
    WHY IT'S WRONG: User gets ZERO value until ALL epics complete. No incremental delivery.
    
    ✅ **CORRECT - User Value Breakdown:**
    
    - Epic 1: Foundation (project setup - necessary exception)
    - Epic 2: User Authentication (user can register/login - VALUE DELIVERED)
    - Epic 3: Content Management (user can create/edit content - VALUE DELIVERED)
    - Epic 4: Social Features (user can share/interact - VALUE DELIVERED)
    
    WHY IT'S RIGHT: Each epic delivers something users can USE. Incremental value.
    
    **Valid Exceptions:**
    
    1. **Foundation Epic**: First epic CAN be setup/infrastructure (greenfield projects need this)
    2. **API-First Epic**: ONLY valid if the API has standalone value (third-party consumers, multiple frontends, API-as-product). If it's just "backend for our frontend", that's the WRONG pattern.
    
    Each epic should:
    
    - Have clear business goal and user value
    - Be independently valuable
    - Contain 3-8 related capabilities
    - Be deliverable in cohesive phase
    
    For greenfield projects:
    
    - First epic MUST establish foundation (project setup, core infrastructure, deployment pipeline)
    - Foundation enables all subsequent work
    
    For complex domains:
    
    - Consider dedicated compliance/regulatory epics
    - Group validation and safety requirements logically
    - Note expertise requirements
    
    Present proposed epic structure showing:
    
    - Epic titles with clear value statements
    - High-level scope of each epic
    - **FR COVERAGE MAP: Which FRs does each epic address?**
      - Example: "Epic 1 (Foundation): Covers infrastructure needs for all FRs"
      - Example: "Epic 2 (User Management): FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5"
      - Example: "Epic 3 (Content System): FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9"
    - Suggested sequencing
    - Why this grouping makes sense
    
    **Validate FR Coverage:**
    
    Check that EVERY FR from Step 1 inventory is mapped to at least one epic.
    If any FRs are unmapped, add them now or explain why they're deferred.

    **CRITICAL - ALTITUDE SHIFT FROM PRD:**
    
    PRD FRs are STRATEGIC (WHAT capabilities):
    
    - ✅ "Users can create accounts"
    
    Epic Stories are TACTICAL (HOW it's implemented):
    
    - Email field with RFC 5322 validation
    - Password requirements: 8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special
    - Password strength meter with visual feedback
    - Email verification within 15 minutes

    - Mobile responsive with 44x44px touch targets
    - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
    
    **THIS IS WHERE YOU ADD ALL THE DETAILS LEFT OUT OF PRD:**
    
    - UI specifics (exact field counts, validation rules, layout details)
    - Performance targets (< 2s, 60fps, etc.)
    - Technical implementation hints (libraries, patterns, APIs)
    - Edge cases (what happens when...)
    - Validation rules (regex patterns, constraints)
    - Error handling (specific error messages, retry logic)
    - Accessibility requirements (ARIA labels, keyboard nav, screen readers)
    - Platform specifics (mobile responsive, browser support)
    
    For each epic, generate:
    
    - Epic title as `epic_title_{{N}}`
    - Epic goal/value as `epic_goal_{{N}}`
    - All stories as repeated pattern `story_title_{{N}}_{{M}}` for each story M
    
    CRITICAL for Epic 1 (Foundation):
    
    - Story 1.1 MUST be project setup/infrastructure initialization
    - Sets up: repo structure, build system, deployment pipeline basics, core dependencies
    - Creates foundation for all subsequent stories
    - Note: Architecture workflow will flesh out technical details
    
    Each story should follow BDD-style acceptance criteria:
    
    **Story Pattern:**
    As a [user type],
    I want [specific capability],
    So that [clear value/benefit].
    
    **Acceptance Criteria using BDD:**
    Given [precondition or initial state]
    When [action or trigger]
    Then [expected outcome]
    
    And [additional criteria as needed]
    
    **Prerequisites:** Only previous stories (never forward dependencies)
    
    **Technical Notes:** Implementation guidance, affected components, compliance requirements
    
    Ensure stories are:
    
    - Vertically sliced (deliver complete functionality, not just one layer)
    - Sequentially ordered (logical progression, no forward dependencies)
    - Independently valuable when possible
    - Small enough for single-session completion
    - Clear enough for autonomous implementation
    
    For each story in epic {{N}}, output variables following this pattern:
    
    - story*title*{{N}}_1, story_title_{{N}}\*2, etc.
    - Each containing: user story, BDD acceptance criteria, prerequisites, technical notes</action>

    **Validate Epic Structure (USER VALUE CHECK):**
    
    For each epic, answer: "What can USERS do after this epic is complete that they couldn't do before?"
    
    - Epic 1: [Must have clear user value OR be Foundation exception]
    - Epic 2: [Must deliver user-facing capability]
    - Epic N: [Must deliver user-facing capability]
    
    ⚠️ RED FLAG: If an epic only delivers technical infrastructure (database layer, API without users, component library without features), RESTRUCTURE IT. Each epic should enable users to accomplish something.
    
    Exception validation:
    
    - Foundation epic: Acceptable as first epic for greenfield projects
    - API-first epic: Acceptable ONLY if API has standalone consumers (third-party integrations, multiple frontends, API-as-product)
    
    If any epic fails this check, restructure before proceeding.
    
    **Validate FR Coverage:**
    
    Create FR Coverage Matrix showing each FR mapped to epic(s) and story(ies):
    
    - FR1: [description] → Epic X, Story X.Y
    - FR2: [description] → Epic X, Story X.Z
    - FR3: [description] → Epic Y, Story Y.A
    - ...
    - FRN: [description] → Epic Z, Story Z.B
    
    Confirm: EVERY FR from Step 1 inventory is covered by at least one story.
    If any FRs are missing, add stories now.
    
    **Validate Story Quality:**
    
    - All functional requirements from PRD are covered by stories
    - Epic 1 establishes proper foundation (if greenfield)
    - All stories are vertically sliced (deliver complete functionality, not just one layer)
    - No forward dependencies exist (only backward references)
    - Story sizing is appropriate for single-session completion
    - BDD acceptance criteria are clear and testable
    - Details added (what was missing from PRD FRs: UI specifics, performance targets, etc.)
    - Domain/compliance requirements are properly distributed
    - Sequencing enables incremental value delivery
    
    Confirm with {user_name}:
    
    - Epic structure makes sense
    - All FRs covered by stories (validated via coverage matrix)
    - Story breakdown is actionable
                                                                                                <check if="ux_design_content && architecture_content">

    **What's the core experience?**

    - What should be absolutely effortless?
    - Which user action is most critical to get right?
    
    **Platform:**

    Not what they'll do, but what emotion or state they should experience:
    
    - Empowered and in control?
    - Delighted and surprised?
    - Efficient and productive?
    - Creative and inspired?
    - Calm and focused?
    - Connected and engaged?
    - Something else?
    
    Really think about the emotional response you want. What feeling would make them tell a friend about this?

          "I found {{design_system_count}} design systems that could work well for your project.
    
          Think of design systems like a foundation - they provide proven UI components and patterns,
          so we're not reinventing buttons and forms. This speeds development and ensures consistency.
    
          **Your Options:**
    
          1. **{{system_name}}**
             - {{key_strengths}}
             - {{component_count}} components | {{accessibility_level}}
             - Best for: {{use_case}}
    
          2. **{{system_name}}**
             - {{key_strengths}}
             - {{component_count}} components | {{accessibility_level}}
             - Best for: {{use_case}}
    
          3. **Custom Design System**
             - Full control over every detail
             - More effort, completely unique to your brand
             - Best for: Strong brand identity needs, unique UX requirements
    
          **My Recommendation:** {{recommendation}} for {{reason}}
    
          This establishes our component foundation and interaction patterns."

                                                                                                    </action>

    When someone describes your app to a friend, what would they say?
    
    **Examples:**
    
    - "It's the app where you swipe to match with people" (Tinder)
    - "You can share photos that disappear" (Snapchat)
    - "It's like having a conversation with AI" (ChatGPT)
    - "Capture and share moments" (Instagram)
    - "Freeform content blocks" (Notion)
    - "Real-time collaborative canvas" (Figma)
    
    **What's yours?** What's the ONE experience that defines your app?
                                                                                                    </ask>
                                                                                                    <action>
                                                                                                      Analyze if this core experience has established UX patterns:
    
        Standard patterns exist for:
        - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
        - E-commerce flows (Browse → Product → Cart → Checkout)
        - Social feeds (Infinite scroll, like/comment)
        - Authentication (Login, signup, password reset)
        - Search and filter
        - Content creation (Forms, editors)
        - Dashboards and analytics
    
        Novel patterns may be needed for:
        - Unique interaction mechanics (before Tinder, swiping wasn't standard)
        - New collaboration models (before Figma, real-time design wasn't solved)
        - Unprecedented content types (before TikTok, vertical short video feeds)
        - Complex multi-step workflows spanning features
        - Innovative gamification or engagement loops
                                                                                                    </action>

    Core UX challenge: {{challenge_description}}
    
    This is exciting - we get to invent the user experience together. Let's design this interaction systematically.
                                                                                                      </output>
                                                                                                      <ask>
                                                                                                        Let's think through the core mechanics of this {{pattern_name}} interaction:
    
    1. **User Goal:** What does the user want to accomplish?
    2. **Trigger:** How should they initiate this action? (button, gesture, voice, drag, etc.)
    3. **Feedback:** What should they see/feel happening?
    4. **Success:** How do they know it succeeded?
    5. **Errors:** What if something goes wrong? How do they recover?
    
    Walk me through your mental model for this interaction - the ideal experience from the user's perspective.

        Priority screens:
        1. Entry point (landing page, dashboard, home screen)
        2. Core action screen (where primary user task happens)
        3. Critical conversion (signup, create, submit, purchase)
    
        For each screen, extract:
        - Primary goal of this screen
        - Key information to display
        - Primary action(s)
        - Secondary actions
        - Navigation context

        Vary these dimensions:
    
        **Layout Approach:**
        - Sidebar navigation vs top nav vs floating action button
        - Single column vs multi-column
        - Card-based vs list-based vs grid
        - Centered vs left-aligned content
    
        **Visual Hierarchy:**
        - Dense (information-rich) vs Spacious (breathing room)
        - Bold headers vs subtle headers
        - Imagery-heavy vs text-focused
    
        **Interaction Patterns:**
        - Modal workflows vs inline expansion
        - Progressive disclosure vs all-at-once
        - Drag-and-drop vs click-to-select
    
        **Visual Weight:**
        - Minimal (lots of white space, subtle borders)
        - Balanced (clear structure, moderate visual weight)
        - Rich (gradients, shadows, visual depth)
        - Maximalist (bold, high contrast, dense)
    
        **Content Approach:**
        - Scannable (lists, cards, quick consumption)
        - Immersive (large imagery, storytelling)
        - Data-driven (charts, tables, metrics)
                                                                                                    </action>

        Create: {design_directions_html}
    
        For EACH design direction (6-8 total):
    
        **Full-Screen Mockup:**
        - Complete HTML/CSS implementation
        - Using chosen color theme
        - Real (or realistic placeholder) content
        - Interactive states (hover effects, focus states)
        - Responsive behavior
    
        **Design Philosophy Label:**
        - Direction name (e.g., "Dense Dashboard", "Spacious Explorer", "Card Gallery")
        - Personality (e.g., "Professional & Efficient", "Friendly & Approachable")
        - Best for (e.g., "Power users who need lots of info", "First-time visitors who need guidance")
    
        **Key Characteristics:**
        - Layout: {{approach}}
        - Density: {{level}}
        - Navigation: {{style}}
        - Primary action prominence: {{high_medium_low}}
    
        **Navigation Controls:**
        - Previous/Next buttons to cycle through directions
        - Thumbnail grid to jump to any direction
        - Side-by-side comparison mode (show 2-3 at once)
        - Responsive preview toggle (desktop/tablet/mobile)
        - Favorite/flag directions for later comparison
    
        **Notes Section:**
        - User can click to add notes about each direction
        - "What I like" and "What I'd change" fields
                                                                                                    </action>

    I've created {{mockup_count}} different design approaches for your key screens.
    
    Open: {design_directions_html}
    
    Each mockup shows a complete vision for your app's look and feel.
    
    As you explore, look for:
    ✓ Which layout feels most intuitive for your users?
    ✓ Which information hierarchy matches your priorities?
    ✓ Which interaction style fits your core experience?
    ✓ Which visual weight feels right for your brand?
    
    You can:
    
    - Navigate through all directions
    - Compare them side-by-side
    - Toggle between desktop/mobile views
    - Add notes about what you like
    
    Take your time - this is a crucial decision!
                                                                                                    </output>

    You can:
    
    - Pick a favorite by number: "Direction #3 is perfect!"
    - Combine elements: "The layout from #2 with the density of #5"
    - Request modifications: "I like #6 but can we make it less dense?"
    - Ask me to explore variations: "Can you show me more options like #4 but with side navigation?"

    Walk me through how a user should accomplish this task:
    
    1. **Entry:** What's the first thing they see/do?
    2. **Input:** What information do they need to provide?
    3. **Feedback:** What should they see/feel along the way?
    4. **Success:** How do they know they succeeded?
    
    As you think through this, consider:
    
    - What's the minimum number of steps to value?
    - Where are the decision points and branching?
    - How do they recover from errors?
    - Should we show everything upfront, or progressively?

    These patterns determine how {{project_name}} behaves in common situations - like how buttons work, how forms validate, how modals behave, etc.
                                                                                                    </output>
                                                                                                    <ask>
                                                                                                      For each pattern category below, I'll present options and a recommendation. Tell me your preferences or ask questions.
    
    **Pattern Categories to Decide:**
    
    - Button hierarchy (primary, secondary, destructive)
    - Feedback patterns (success, error, loading)
    - Form patterns (labels, validation, help text)
    - Modal patterns (size, dismiss, focus)
    - Navigation patterns (active state, back button)
    - Empty state patterns
    - Confirmation patterns (delete, unsaved changes)
    - Notification patterns
    - Search patterns
    - Date/time patterns
    
    For each one, do you want to:

    2. Focus only on the most critical patterns for your app (focused)
    3. Let me recommend defaults and you override where needed (efficient)
                                                                                                    </ask>
                                                                                                    <action>
                                                                                                      Based on user choice, facilitate pattern decisions with appropriate depth: - If thorough: Present all categories with options and reasoning - If focused: Identify 3-5 critical patterns based on app type - If efficient: Recommend smart defaults, ask for overrides
    
        For each pattern decision, document:
        - Pattern category
        - Chosen approach
        - Rationale (why this choice for this app)
        - Example scenarios where it applies
                                                                                                    </action>
                                                                                                    <template-output>

    Target devices from PRD: {{devices}}
    
    For responsive design:
    
    1. **Desktop** (large screens):
       - How should we use the extra space?
       - Multi-column layouts?
       - Side navigation?
    
    2. **Tablet** (medium screens):
       - Simplified layout from desktop?
       - Touch-optimized interactions?
       - Portrait vs landscape considerations?
    
    3. **Mobile** (small screens):
       - Bottom navigation or hamburger menu?
       - How do multi-column layouts collapse?
       - Touch target sizes adequate?
    
    What's most important for each screen size?
                                                                                                    </ask>
                                                                                                    <action>
                                                                                                      Define breakpoint strategy:
    
        Based on chosen layout pattern from design direction:
    
        Breakpoints:
        - Mobile: {{max_width}} ({{cols}}-column layout, {{nav_pattern}})
        - Tablet: {{range}} ({{cols}}-column layout, {{nav_pattern}})
        - Desktop: {{min_width}} ({{cols}}-column layout, {{nav_pattern}})
    
        Adaptation Patterns:
        - Navigation: {{how_it_changes}}
        - Sidebar: {{collapse_hide_convert}}
        - Cards/Lists: {{grid_to_single_column}}
        - Tables: {{horizontal_scroll_card_view_hide_columns}}
        - Modals: {{full_screen_on_mobile}}
        - Forms: {{layout_changes}}
                                                                                                    </action>
                                                                                                    <action>
                                                                                                      Define accessibility strategy:
                                                                                                      <ask>
                                                                                                        Let's define your accessibility strategy.
    
    Accessibility means your app works for everyone, including people with disabilities:
    
    - Can someone using only a keyboard navigate?
    - Can someone using a screen reader understand what's on screen?
    - Can someone with color blindness distinguish important elements?
    - Can someone with motor difficulties use your buttons?
    
    **WCAG Compliance Levels:**
    
    - **Level A** - Basic accessibility (minimum)
    - **Level AA** - Recommended standard, legally required for government/education/public sites
    - **Level AAA** - Highest standard (not always practical for all content)
    
    **Legal Context:**
    
    - Government/Education: Must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA
    - Public websites (US): ADA requires accessibility
    - EU: Accessibility required
    
    Based on your deployment intent: {{recommendation}}
    
    **What level should we target?**
                                                                                                      </ask>
                                                                                                      Accessibility Requirements:
    
        Compliance Target: {{WCAG_level}}
    
        Key Requirements:
        - Color contrast: {{ratio_required}} (text vs background)
        - Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements accessible
        - Focus indicators: Visible focus states on all interactive elements
        - ARIA labels: Meaningful labels for screen readers
        - Alt text: Descriptive text for all meaningful images
        - Form labels: Proper label associations
        - Error identification: Clear, descriptive error messages
        - Touch target size: Minimum {{size}} for mobile
    
        Testing Strategy:
        - Automated: {{tools}} (Lighthouse, axe DevTools)
        - Manual: Keyboard-only navigation testing
        - Screen reader: {{tool}} testing
                                                                                                    </action>

    - Color theme and typography
    - Design direction and layout
    - Component styles
    - Navigation patterns
    
    **2. User Journey Visualization** - Step-by-step HTML mockup of one of your critical user journeys with:
    
    - Each screen in the flow
    - Interactive transitions
    - Success states and feedback

    - [ ] **Existing stories complexity reassessed** based on UX design:
      - [ ] Stories that are now more complex (UX revealed additional requirements)
      - [ ] Stories that are simpler (design system handles more than expected)
      - [ ] Stories that should be split (UX design shows multiple components/flows)
      - [ ] Stories that can be combined (UX design shows they're tightly coupled)
    
    ### Epic Alignment
    
    - [ ] **Epic scope still accurate** after UX design
    - [ ] **New epic needed** for discovered work (if significant)
    - [ ] **Epic ordering might change** based on UX dependencies
    
    ### Action Items for Epics File Update
    
    - [ ] **List of new stories to add** to epics.md documented
    - [ ] **Complexity adjustments noted** for existing stories
    - [ ] **Update epics.md** OR flag for architecture review first
    - [ ] **Rationale documented** for why new stories/changes are needed
    
    **Note:** If significant story changes are identified, consider running architecture workflow BEFORE updating epics.md, since architecture decisions might reveal additional adjustments needed.

    ## 15. Decision Rationale
    
    **Unlike template-driven workflows, this workflow should document WHY**
    
    - [ ] **Design system choice has rationale** (why this fits the project)
    - [ ] **Color theme selection has reasoning** (why this emotional impact)
    - [ ] **Design direction choice explained** (what user liked, how it fits vision)
    - [ ] **User journey approaches justified** (why this flow pattern)
    - [ ] **UX pattern decisions have context** (why these patterns for this app)
    - [ ] **Responsive strategy aligned with user priorities**
    - [ ] **Accessibility level appropriate for deployment intent**
    
    ---
    
    ## 16. Implementation Readiness
    
    - [ ] **Designers can create high-fidelity mockups** from this spec
    - [ ] **Developers can implement** with clear UX guidance
    - [ ] **Sufficient detail** for frontend development
    - [ ] **Component specifications actionable** (states, variants, behaviors)
    - [ ] **Flows implementable** (clear steps, decision logic, error handling)
    - [ ] **Visual foundation complete** (colors, typography, spacing all defined)
    - [ ] **Pattern consistency enforceable** (clear rules for implementation)
    
    ---
    
    ## 17. Critical Failures (Auto-Fail)
    
    - [ ] ❌ **No visual collaboration** (color themes or design mockups not generated)
    - [ ] ❌ **User not involved in decisions** (auto-generated without collaboration)
    - [ ] ❌ **No design direction chosen** (missing key visual decisions)
    - [ ] ❌ **No user journey designs** (critical flows not documented)
    - [ ] ❌ **No UX pattern consistency rules** (implementation will be inconsistent)
    - [ ] ❌ **Missing core experience definition** (no clarity on what makes app unique)
    - [ ] ❌ **No component specifications** (components not actionable)
    - [ ] ❌ **Responsive strategy missing** (for multi-platform projects)
    - [ ] ❌ **Accessibility ignored** (no compliance target or requirements)
    - [ ] ❌ **Generic/templated content** (not specific to this project)
