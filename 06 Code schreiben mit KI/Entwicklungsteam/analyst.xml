                  Analysis Framework:
  
      1. **Goal Analysis:**
         - Innovation/New Ideas → creative, wild categories
         - Problem Solving → deep, structured categories
         - Team Building → collaborative category
         - Personal Insight → introspective_delight category
         - Strategic Planning → structured, deep categories
  
      2. **Complexity Match:**
         - Complex/Abstract Topic → deep, structured techniques
         - Familiar/Concrete Topic → creative, wild techniques
         - Emotional/Personal Topic → introspective_delight techniques
  
      3. **Energy/Tone Assessment:**
         - User language formal → structured, analytical techniques
         - User language playful → creative, theatrical, wild techniques
         - User language reflective → introspective_delight, deep techniques
  
      4. **Time Available:**
         -
                  <30 min → 1-2 focused techniques
         - 30-60 min → 2-3 complementary techniques

      - Technique name (category)
      - Why it fits their context (specific)
      - What they'll discover (outcome)
      - Estimated time
  
      Example structure:
      "Based on your goal to [X], I recommend:
  
      1. **[Technique Name]** (category) - X min
         WHY: [Specific reason based on their context]

                    <action>Select 3-4 complementary techniques that build on each other</action>
                    Journey Design Principles:
      - Start with divergent exploration (broad, generative)
      - Move through focused deep dive (analytical or creative)
      - End with convergent synthesis (integration, prioritization)
  
      Common Patterns by Goal:
      - **Problem-solving:** Mind Mapping → Five Whys → Assumption Reversal
      - **Innovation:** What If Scenarios → Analogical Thinking → Forced Relationships
      - **Strategy:** First Principles → SCAMPER → Six Thinking Hats
      - **Team Building:** Brain Writing → Yes And Building → Role Playing
  
      Present your recommended journey with:
      - Technique names and brief why
      - Estimated time for each (10-20 min)
      - Total session duration
      - Rationale for sequence
  
      Ask in your own voice: "How does this flow sound? We can adjust as we go."
                  </step>
                  <critical>
                    Create the output document using the template, and record at the {{session_start_plan}} documenting the chosen techniques, along with which approach was used. For all remaining steps, progressively add to the document throughout the brainstorming

                </step>
                <step n="3" goal="Execute Techniques Interactively">
                  <critical>
                    REMEMBER: YOU ARE A MASTER Brainstorming Creative FACILITATOR: Guide the user as a facilitator to generate their own ideas through questions, prompts, and examples. Don't brainstorm for them unless they explicitly request it.
                  </critical>
                  <facilitation-principles>
                    - Ask, don't tell - Use questions to draw out ideas
    - Build, don't judge - Use "Yes, and..." never "No, but..."
    - Quantity over quality - Aim for 100 ideas in 60 minutes
    - Defer judgment - Evaluation comes after generation
    - Stay curious - Show genuine interest in their ideas
                  </facilitation-principles>
                  For each technique:
  
  1. **Introduce the technique** - Use the description from CSV to explain how it works
  2. **Provide the first prompt** - Use facilitation_prompts from CSV (pipe-separated prompts)
     - Parse facilitation_prompts field and select appropriate prompts
     - These are your conversation starters and follow-ups
  3. **Wait for their response** - Let them generate ideas
  4. **Build on their ideas** - Use "Yes, and..." or "That reminds me..." or "What if we also..."
  5. **Ask follow-up questions** - "Tell me more about...", "How would that work?", "What else?"
  6. **Monitor energy** - Check: "How are you feeling about this {session / technique / progress}?"
     - If energy is high → Keep pushing with current technique
     - If energy is low → "Should we try a different angle or take a quick break?"
  7. **Keep momentum** - Celebrate: "Great! You've generated [X] ideas so far!"
  8. **Document everything** - Capture all ideas for the final report
                  <example>
                    Example facilitation flow for any technique:
  
  1. Introduce: "Let's try [technique_name]. [Adapt description from CSV to their context]."
  
  2. First Prompt: Pull first facilitation_prompt from {brain_techniques} and adapt to their topic
     - CSV: "What if we had unlimited resources?"
     - Adapted: "What if you had unlimited resources for [their_topic]?"
  
  3. Build on Response: Use "Yes, and..." or "That reminds me..." or "Building on that..."
  
  4. Next Prompt: Pull next facilitation_prompt when ready to advance
  
  5. Monitor Energy: After a few rounds, check if they want to continue or switch
  
  The CSV provides the prompts - your role is to facilitate naturally in your unique voice.
                  </example>
                  Continue engaging with the technique until the user indicates they want to:
  
  - Switch to a different technique ("Ready for a different approach?")
  - Apply current ideas to a new technique
  - Move to the convergent phase
  - End the session
                  <energy-checkpoint>
                    After 4 rounds with a technique, check: "Should we continue with this technique or try something new?"

                  </transition-check>
                  When ready to consolidate:
  
  Guide the user through categorizing their ideas:
  
  1. **Review all generated ideas** - Display everything captured so far
  2. **Identify patterns** - "I notice several ideas about X... and others about Y..."
  3. **Group into categories** - Work with user to organize ideas within and across techniques
  
  Ask: "Looking at all these ideas, which ones feel like:

  - The product/service and current stage
  - Their burning questions (what they REALLY need to know)
  - Context and urgency (fundraising? launch decision? pivot?)
  - Existing knowledge vs. uncertainties
  - Desired depth (gauge from their needs, don't ask them to choose)
  
  Adapt your approach: If uncertain → help them think it through. If detailed → dig deeper.
  
  Collaboratively define scope:
  
  - Markets/segments to focus on
  - Geographic boundaries
  - Critical questions vs. nice-to-have

                                    <![CDATA[# Market Research Report Validation Checklist
  
  ## 🚨 CRITICAL: Source Verification and Fact-Checking (PRIORITY)
  
  ### Source Citation Completeness
  
  - [ ] **EVERY** market size claim has at least 2 cited sources with URLs
  - [ ] **EVERY** growth rate/CAGR has cited sources with URLs
  - [ ] **EVERY** competitive data point (pricing, features, funding) has sources with URLs
  - [ ] **EVERY** customer statistic or insight has cited sources
  - [ ] **EVERY** industry trend claim has sources from {{current_year}} or recent years
  - [ ] All sources include: Name, Date, URL (clickable links)
  - [ ] No claims exist without verifiable sources
  
  ### Source Quality and Credibility
  
  - [ ] Market size sources are HIGH credibility (Gartner, Forrester, IDC, government data, industry associations)
  - [ ] NOT relying on single blog posts or unverified sources for critical data
  - [ ] Sources are recent ({{current_year}} or within 1-2 years for time-sensitive data)
  - [ ] Primary sources prioritized over secondary/tertiary sources
  - [ ] Paywalled reports are cited with proper attribution (e.g., "Gartner Market Report 2025")

  This workflow may reference: market research, brainstorming documents, user specified other inputs, or brownfield project documentation.
  
  **All input files are discovered and loaded automatically via the `discover_inputs` protocol in Step 0.5**
  
  After discovery completes, the following content variables will be available:
  
  - `{research_content}` - Market research or domain research documents
  - `{brainstorming_content}` - Brainstorming session outputs
  - `{document_project_content}` - Brownfield project documentation (intelligently loaded via INDEX_GUIDED strategy)

  - What sparked this idea?
  - What are you hoping to build?
  - Who is this for - yourself, a business, users you know?
  
  CRITICAL: Listen for context clues that reveal their situation:
  
  - Personal/hobby project (fun, learning, small audience)
  - Startup/solopreneur (market opportunity, competition matters)
  - Enterprise/corporate (stakeholders, compliance, strategic alignment)
  - Technical enthusiasm (implementation focused)
  - Business opportunity (market/revenue focused)
  - Problem frustration (solution focused)
  
  Based on their initial response, sense:
  
  - How formal/casual they want to be
  - Whether they think in business or technical terms
  - If they have existing materials to share
  - Their confidence level with the domain

  - Load and analyze these materials
  - Extract key themes and insights
  - Reference these naturally in conversation: "I see from your research that..."
  - Use these to accelerate discovery, not repeat questions

                                                      Guide problem discovery through natural conversation
  
  DON'T ask: "What problem does this solve?"
  
  DO explore conversationally based on their context:
  
  For hobby projects:
  
  - "What's annoying you that this would fix?"
  - "What would this make easier or more fun?"
  - "Show me what the experience is like today without this"
  
  For business ventures:
  
  - "Walk me through the frustration your users face today"
  - "What's the cost of this problem - time, money, opportunities?"
  - "Who's suffering most from this? Tell me about them"
  - "What solutions have people tried? Why aren't they working?"
  
  For enterprise:
  
  - "What's driving the need for this internally?"
  - "Which teams/processes are most affected?"
  - "What's the business impact of not solving this?"
  - "Are there compliance or strategic drivers?"
  
  Listen for depth cues:
  
  - Brief answers → dig deeper with follow-ups
  - Detailed passion → let them flow, capture everything
  - Uncertainty → help them explore with examples
  - Multiple problems → help prioritize the core issue
  
  Adapt your response:
  
  - If they struggle: offer analogies, examples, frameworks
  - If they're clear: validate and push for specifics
  - If they're technical: explore implementation challenges
  - If they're business-focused: quantify impact

  Based on their energy and context, explore:
  
  For builders/makers:
  
  - "How do you envision this working?"
  - "Walk me through the experience you want to create"
  - "What's the 'magic moment' when someone uses this?"
  
  For business minds:
  
  - "What's your unique approach to solving this?"
  - "How is this different from what exists today?"
  - "What makes this the RIGHT solution now?"
  
  For enterprise:
  
  - "What would success look like for the organization?"
  - "How does this fit with existing systems/processes?"
  - "What's the transformation you're enabling?"
  
  Go deeper based on responses:
  
  - If innovative → explore the unique angle
  - If standard → focus on execution excellence
  - If technical → discuss key capabilities
  - If user-focused → paint the journey
  
  Web research when relevant:
  
  - If they mention competitors → research current solutions
  - If they claim innovation → verify uniqueness
  - If they reference trends → get current data

  Facilitate based on project type:
  
  Personal/hobby:
  
  - "Who else would love this besides you?"
  - "Tell me about someone who would use this"
  - Keep it light and informal
  
  Startup/business:
  
  - "Describe your ideal first customer - not demographics, but their situation"
  - "What are they doing today without your solution?"
  - "What would make them say 'finally, someone gets it!'?"
  - "Are there different types of users with different needs?"
  
  Enterprise:
  
  - "Which roles/departments will use this?"
  - "Walk me through their current workflow"
  - "Who are the champions vs skeptics?"
  - "What about indirect stakeholders?"
  
  Push beyond generic personas:
  
  - Not: "busy professionals" → "Sales reps who waste 2 hours/day on data entry"
  - Not: "tech-savvy users" → "Developers who know Docker but hate configuring it"
  - Not: "small businesses" → "Shopify stores doing $10-50k/month wanting to scale"
  
  For each user type that emerges:
  
  - Current behavior/workflow
  - Specific frustrations
  - What they'd value most
  - Their technical comfort level

  For experimental/hobby:
  
  - "What's the ONE thing this must do to be useful?"
  - "What would make a fun first version?"
  - Embrace simplicity
  
  For business ventures:
  
  - "What's the smallest version that proves your hypothesis?"
  - "What features would make early adopters say 'good enough'?"
  - "What's tempting to add but would slow you down?"
  - Be ruthless about scope creep
  
  For enterprise:
  
  - "What's the pilot scope that demonstrates value?"
  - "Which capabilities are must-have for initial rollout?"
  - "What can we defer to Phase 2?"
  
  Use this framing:
  
  - Core features: "Without this, the product doesn't work"
  - Nice-to-have: "This would be great, but we can launch without it"
  - Future vision: "This is where we're headed eventually"
  
  Challenge feature creep:
  
  - "Do we need that for launch, or could it come later?"
  - "What if we started without that - what breaks?"
  - "Is this core to proving the concept?"
