        When you need to access a file path like "bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml":
        1. Find the &lt;file id="bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml"&gt; element in this document
        2. Extract the content from within the CDATA section

  - Load {project_types_data} - contains project type definitions, detection signals, and requirements
  - Load {domain_complexity_data} - contains domain classifications, complexity levels, and special requirements
  
  Parse CSV structure:
  
  - project_types_data has columns: project_type, detection_signals, key_questions, required_sections, skip_sections, web_search_triggers, innovation_signals
  - domain_complexity_data has columns: domain, signals, complexity, key_concerns, required_knowledge, suggested_workflow, web_searches, special_sections
  
  Store these in memory for use throughout the workflow.

            <action>
              Begin natural discovery conversation:
  "Tell me about what you want to build - what problem does it solve and for whom?"

  1. PROJECT TYPE classification
  2. DOMAIN classification

            <action>
              DUAL DETECTION - Use CSV data to match:
  
  **Project Type Detection:**
  
  - Compare user's description against detection_signals from each row in project_types_data
  - Look for keyword matches (semicolon-separated in CSV)
  - Identify best matching project_type (api_backend, mobile_app, saas_b2b, developer_tool, cli_tool, web_app, game, desktop_app, iot_embedded, blockchain_web3)
  - If multiple matches, ask clarifying question
  - Store matched project_type value
  
  **Domain Detection:**
  
  - Compare user's description against signals from each row in domain_complexity_data
  - Match domain keywords (semicolon-separated in CSV)
  - Identify domain (healthcare, fintech, govtech, edtech, aerospace, automotive, scientific, legaltech, insuretech, energy, gaming, general)
  - Get complexity level from matched row (high/medium/low/redirect)
  - Store matched domain and complexity_level values
  
  **Special Cases from CSV:**
  
  - If project_type = "game" → Use project_types_data row to get redirect message
  - If domain = "gaming" → Use domain_complexity_data redirect action
  - If complexity = "high" → Note suggested_workflow and web_searches from domain row
            </action>
            <action>
              SPECIAL ROUTING based on detected values:
  
  **If game detected (from project_types_data):**
  "Game development requires the BMGD module (BMad Game Development) which has specialized workflows for game design."
  Exit workflow and redirect to BMGD.
  
  **If complex domain detected (complexity = "high" from domain_complexity_data):**
  Extract suggested_workflow and web_searches from the matched domain row.
  Offer domain research options:
  A) Run {suggested_workflow} workflow (thorough) - from CSV
  B) Quick web search using {web_searches} queries - from CSV
  C) User provides their own domain context
  D) Continue with general knowledge
  
  Present the options and WAIT for user choice.
            </action>
            <action>
              IDENTIFY WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL early in conversation:
  Ask questions like:
  
  - "What excites you most about this product?"
  - "What would make users love this?"
  - "What's the unique value or compelling moment?"
  - "What makes this different from alternatives?"
  
  Capture this differentiator - it becomes a thread connecting throughout the PRD.

  - Generate the specific template-output (e.g., endpoint_specs → endpoint_specification)
  - These will render in their own subsections in the template
  
  For required_sections that DON'T have matching template variables:
  
  - Include the content in the main project_type_requirements variable
  - This ensures all requirements are captured even if template doesn't have dedicated sections
  
  This hybrid approach balances template structure with CSV-driven flexibility.

            <action>
              Before writing FRs, understand their PURPOSE and USAGE:
  
  **Purpose:**
  FRs define WHAT capabilities the product must have. They are the complete inventory
  of user-facing and system capabilities that deliver the product vision.
  
  **How They Will Be Used:**
  
  1. UX Designer reads FRs → designs interactions for each capability
  2. Architect reads FRs → designs systems to support each capability
  3. PM reads FRs → creates epics and stories to implement each capability
  4. Dev Agent reads assembled context → implements stories based on FRs
  
  **Critical Property - COMPLETENESS:**
  Every capability discussed in vision, scope, domain requirements, and project-specific
  sections MUST be represented as an FR. Missing FRs = missing capabilities.
  
  **Critical Property - ALTITUDE:**
  FRs state WHAT capability exists and WHO it serves, NOT HOW it's implemented or
  specific UI/UX details. Those come later from UX and Architecture.
            </action>
            <action>
              Transform everything discovered into comprehensive functional requirements:
  
  **Coverage - Pull from EVERYWHERE:**
  
  - Core features from MVP scope → FRs
  - Growth features → FRs (marked as post-MVP if needed)
  - Domain-mandated features → FRs
  - Project-type specific needs → FRs
  - Innovation requirements → FRs
  - Anti-patterns (explicitly NOT doing) → Note in FR section if needed
  
  **Organization - Group by CAPABILITY AREA:**
  Don't organize by technology or layer. Group by what users/system can DO:
  
  - ✅ "User Management" (not "Authentication System")
  - ✅ "Content Discovery" (not "Search Algorithm")
  - ✅ "Team Collaboration" (not "WebSocket Infrastructure")
  
  **Format - Flat, Numbered List:**
  Each FR is one clear capability statement:
  
  - FR#: [Actor] can [capability] [context/constraint if needed]
  - Number sequentially (FR1, FR2, FR3...)
  - Aim for 20-50 FRs for typical projects (fewer for simple, more for complex)
  
  **Altitude Check:**
  Each FR should answer "WHAT capability exists?" NOT "HOW is it implemented?"
  
  - ✅ "Users can customize appearance settings"
  - ❌ "Users can toggle light/dark theme with 3 font size options stored in LocalStorage"
  
  The second example belongs in Epic Breakdown, not PRD.
            </action>
            <example>
              **Well-written FRs at the correct altitude:**
  
  **User Account & Access:**
  
  - FR1: Users can create accounts with email or social authentication
  - FR2: Users can log in securely and maintain sessions across devices
  - FR3: Users can reset passwords via email verification
  - FR4: Users can update profile information and preferences
  - FR5: Administrators can manage user roles and permissions
  
  **Content Management:**
  
  - FR6: Users can create, edit, and delete content items
  - FR7: Users can organize content with tags and categories
  - FR8: Users can search content by keyword, tag, or date range
  - FR9: Users can export content in multiple formats
  
  **Data Ownership (local-first products):**
  
  - FR10: All user data stored locally on user's device
  - FR11: Users can export complete data at any time
  - FR12: Users can import previously exported data
  - FR13: System monitors storage usage and warns before limits
  
  **Collaboration:**
  
  - FR14: Users can share content with specific users or teams
  - FR15: Users can comment on shared content
  - FR16: Users can track content change history
  - FR17: Users receive notifications for relevant updates
  
  **Notice:**
  ✅ Each FR is a testable capability
  ✅ Each FR is implementation-agnostic (could be built many ways)
  ✅ Each FR specifies WHO and WHAT, not HOW
  ✅ No UI details, no performance numbers, no technology choices
  ✅ Comprehensive coverage of capability areas
            </example>
            <action>
              Generate the complete FR list by systematically extracting capabilities:
  
  1. MVP scope → extract all capabilities → write as FRs
  2. Growth features → extract capabilities → write as FRs (note if post-MVP)
  3. Domain requirements → extract mandatory capabilities → write as FRs
  4. Project-type specifics → extract type-specific capabilities → write as FRs
  5. Innovation patterns → extract novel capabilities → write as FRs
  
  Organize FRs by logical capability groups (5-8 groups typically).
  Number sequentially across all groups (FR1, FR2... FR47).
            </action>
            <action>
              SELF-VALIDATION - Before finalizing, ask yourself:
  
  **Completeness Check:**
  
  1. "Did I cover EVERY capability mentioned in the MVP scope section?"
  2. "Did I include domain-specific requirements as FRs?"
  3. "Did I cover the project-type specific needs (API/Mobile/SaaS/etc)?"
  4. "Could a UX designer read ONLY the FRs and know what to design?"
  5. "Could an Architect read ONLY the FRs and know what to support?"
  6. "Are there any user actions or system behaviors we discussed that have no FR?"
  
  **Altitude Check:**
  
  1. "Am I stating capabilities (WHAT) or implementation (HOW)?"
  2. "Am I listing acceptance criteria or UI specifics?" (Remove if yes)
  3. "Could this FR be implemented 5 different ways?" (Good - means it's not prescriptive)
  
  **Quality Check:**
  
  1. "Is each FR clear enough that someone could test whether it exists?"
  2. "Is each FR independent (not dependent on reading other FRs to understand)?"
  3. "Did I avoid vague terms like 'good', 'fast', 'easy'?" (Use NFRs for quality attributes)
  
  COMPLETENESS GATE: Review your FR list against the entire PRD written so far and think hard - did you miss anything? Add it now before proceeding.

  - [ ] Stories are AI-agent sized (completable in 2-4 hour session)
  
  ---
  
  ## 4. FR Coverage Validation (CRITICAL)
  
  ### Complete Traceability
  
  - [ ] **Every FR from PRD.md is covered by at least one story in epics.md**
  - [ ] Each story references relevant FR numbers
  - [ ] No orphaned FRs (requirements without stories)
  - [ ] No orphaned stories (stories without FR connection)
  - [ ] Coverage matrix verified (can trace FR → Epic → Stories)
  
  ### Coverage Quality

  ---
  
  ## Critical Failures (Auto-Fail)
  
  If ANY of these are true, validation FAILS:
  
  - [ ] ❌ **No epics.md file exists** (two-file output required)
  - [ ] ❌ **Epic 1 doesn't establish foundation** (violates core sequencing principle)
  - [ ] ❌ **Stories have forward dependencies** (breaks sequential implementation)
  - [ ] ❌ **Stories not vertically sliced** (horizontal layers block value delivery)
  - [ ] ❌ **Epics don't cover all FRs** (orphaned requirements)
  - [ ] ❌ **FRs contain technical implementation details** (should be in architecture)
  - [ ] ❌ **No FR traceability to stories** (can't validate coverage)
  - [ ] ❌ **Template variables unfilled** (incomplete document)
  
  ---
  
  ## Validation Summary
  
  - **Pass Rate ≥ 95%:** ✅ EXCELLENT - Ready for architecture phase
  - **Pass Rate 85-94%:** ⚠️ GOOD - Minor fixes needed
  - **Pass Rate 70-84%:** ⚠️ FAIR - Important issues to address
  - **Pass Rate < 70%:** ❌ POOR - Significant rework required
  
  ### Critical Issue Threshold
  
  - **0 Critical Failures:** Proceed to fixes
  - **1+ Critical Failures:** STOP - Must fix critical issues first
  
  ---
  
  ## Validation Execution Notes
  
  **When validating:**
  
  1. **Load ALL documents - whole or sharded (but not both of each) for example epics.md vs epics/\*.md:**
     - PRD.md (required)
     - epics.md (required)
     - product-brief.md (if exists)
     - domain-brief.md (if exists)
     - research documents (if referenced)
  
  2. **Validate in order:**
     - Check critical failures first (immediate stop if any found)
     - Verify PRD completeness
     - Verify epics completeness
     - Cross-reference FR coverage (most important)
     - Check sequencing (second most important)
     - Validate research integration
     - Check polish and quality
  
  3. **Report findings:**
     - List critical failures prominently
     - Group issues by severity
     - Provide specific line numbers/sections
     - Suggest concrete fixes
     - Highlight what's working well
  
  4. **Provide actionable next steps:**
     - If validation passes: "Ready for architecture workflow"
     - If minor issues: "Fix [X] items then re-validate"
     - If major issues: "Rework [sections] then re-validate"
     - If critical failures: "Must fix critical items before proceeding"
  
  ---
  
  **Remember:** This validation ensures the entire planning phase is complete and the implementation phase has everything needed to succeed. Be thorough but fair - the goal is quality, not perfection.

                    ⚠️ EPIC STRUCTURE PRINCIPLE: Each epic MUST deliver USER VALUE, not just technical capability. Epics are NOT organized by technical layers (database, API, frontend). Each epic should result in something USERS can actually use or benefit from. Exception: Foundation/setup stories at the start of first epic are acceptable. Another valid exception: API-first epic ONLY when the API itself has standalone value (e.g., will be consumed by third parties or multiple frontends).

                    BMAD METHOD WORKFLOW POSITION: This workflow can be invoked at multiple points - after PRD only, after PRD+UX, after PRD+UX+Architecture, or to update existing epics. If epics.md already exists, ASK the user: (1) CONTINUING - previous run was incomplete, (2) REPLACING - starting fresh/discarding old, (3) UPDATING - new planning document created since last epic generation

  - PRD.md (required)
  - domain-brief.md (if exists)
  - product-brief.md (if exists)
  
  **CRITICAL - PRD FRs Are Now Flat and Strategic:**
  
  The PRD contains FLAT, capability-level functional requirements (FR1, FR2, FR3...).
  These are STRATEGIC (WHAT capabilities exist), NOT tactical (HOW they're implemented).
  
  Example PRD FRs:
  
  - FR1: Users can create accounts with email or social authentication
  - FR2: Users can log in securely and maintain sessions
  - FR6: Users can create, edit, and delete content items
  
  **Your job in THIS workflow:**
  
  1. Map each FR to one or more epics
  2. Break each FR into stories with DETAILED acceptance criteria
  3. Add ALL the implementation details that were intentionally left out of PRD
  
  Extract from PRD:
  
  - ALL functional requirements (flat numbered list)
  - Non-functional requirements
  - Domain considerations and compliance needs
  - Project type and complexity
  - MVP vs growth vs vision scope boundaries
  - Product differentiator (what makes it special)
  - Technical constraints
  - User types and their goals
  - Success criteria
  
  **Create FR Inventory:**
  
  List all FRs to ensure coverage:
  
  - FR1: [description]
  - FR2: [description]
  - ...
  - FRN: [description]
  
  This inventory will be used to validate complete coverage in Step 4.

                            **MAINTAIN existing epic structure:**
  
  Use the epic structure already defined in epics.md:
  
  - Keep all existing epic titles and goals
  - Preserve epic sequencing
  - Maintain FR coverage mapping
  
  Note: We're enhancing stories within existing epics, not restructuring.

  Will enhance stories within these epics using new context.

                            Analyze requirements and identify natural epic boundaries
  
  INTENT: Find organic groupings that make sense for THIS product
  
  Look for natural patterns:
  
  - Features that work together cohesively
  - User journeys that connect
  - Business capabilities that cluster
  - Domain requirements that relate (compliance, validation, security)
  - Technical systems that should be built together
  
  Name epics based on VALUE, not technical layers:
  
  - Good: "User Onboarding", "Content Discovery", "Compliance Framework"
  - Avoid: "Database Layer", "API Endpoints", "Frontend"
  
  **⚠️ ANTI-PATTERN EXAMPLES (DO NOT DO THIS):**
  
  ❌ **WRONG - Technical Layer Breakdown:**
  
  - Epic 1: Database Schema & Models
  - Epic 2: API Layer / Backend Services
  - Epic 3: Frontend UI Components
  - Epic 4: Integration & Testing
  
  WHY IT'S WRONG: User gets ZERO value until ALL epics complete. No incremental delivery.
  
  ✅ **CORRECT - User Value Breakdown:**
  
  - Epic 1: Foundation (project setup - necessary exception)
  - Epic 2: User Authentication (user can register/login - VALUE DELIVERED)
  - Epic 3: Content Management (user can create/edit content - VALUE DELIVERED)
  - Epic 4: Social Features (user can share/interact - VALUE DELIVERED)
  
  WHY IT'S RIGHT: Each epic delivers something users can USE. Incremental value.
  
  **Valid Exceptions:**
  
  1. **Foundation Epic**: First epic CAN be setup/infrastructure (greenfield projects need this)
  2. **API-First Epic**: ONLY valid if the API has standalone value (third-party consumers, multiple frontends, API-as-product). If it's just "backend for our frontend", that's the WRONG pattern.
  
  Each epic should:
  
  - Have clear business goal and user value
  - Be independently valuable
  - Contain 3-8 related capabilities
  - Be deliverable in cohesive phase
  
  For greenfield projects:
  
  - First epic MUST establish foundation (project setup, core infrastructure, deployment pipeline)
  - Foundation enables all subsequent work
  
  For complex domains:
  
  - Consider dedicated compliance/regulatory epics
  - Group validation and safety requirements logically
  - Note expertise requirements
  
  Present proposed epic structure showing:
  
  - Epic titles with clear value statements
  - High-level scope of each epic
  - **FR COVERAGE MAP: Which FRs does each epic address?**
    - Example: "Epic 1 (Foundation): Covers infrastructure needs for all FRs"
    - Example: "Epic 2 (User Management): FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5"
    - Example: "Epic 3 (Content System): FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9"
  - Suggested sequencing
  - Why this grouping makes sense
  
  **Validate FR Coverage:**
  
  Check that EVERY FR from Step 1 inventory is mapped to at least one epic.
  If any FRs are unmapped, add them now or explain why they're deferred.

  For each existing story in Epic {{N}}:
  
  1. Preserve core story structure (title, user story statement)
  2. Add/enhance based on available NEW context:
                            <check if="ADD_UX_DETAILS">
                              **Add from UX Design:**
      - Specific mockup/wireframe references
      - Exact interaction patterns
      - Animation/transition specifications
      - Responsive breakpoints
      - Component specifications
      - Error states and feedback patterns
      - Accessibility requirements (WCAG compliance)
  
      Example enhancement:
      BEFORE: "User can log in"
      AFTER: "User can log in via modal (UX pg 12-15) with email/password fields,
              password visibility toggle, remember me checkbox,
              loading state during auth (spinner overlay),
              error messages below fields (red, 14px),
              success redirects to dashboard with fade transition"

                            <check if="ADD_ARCH_DETAILS">
                              **Add from Architecture:**
      - Specific API endpoints and contracts
      - Data model references
      - Tech stack implementation details
      - Performance requirements
      - Security implementation notes
      - Cache strategies
      - Error handling patterns
  
      Example enhancement:
      BEFORE: "System authenticates user"
      AFTER: "System authenticates user via POST /api/v1/auth/login,
              validates against users table (see Arch section 6.2),
              returns JWT token (expires 7d) + refresh token (30d),

                            Break down Epic {{N}} into small, implementable stories
  
  INTENT: Create stories sized for single dev agent completion
  
  **CRITICAL - ALTITUDE SHIFT FROM PRD:**
  
  PRD FRs are STRATEGIC (WHAT capabilities):
  
  - ✅ "Users can create accounts"
  
  Epic Stories are TACTICAL (HOW it's implemented):
  
  - Email field with RFC 5322 validation
  - Password requirements: 8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special
  - Password strength meter with visual feedback
  - Email verification within 15 minutes
  - reCAPTCHA v3 integration
  - Account creation completes in
                            < 2 seconds
  - Mobile responsive with 44x44px touch targets
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
  
  **THIS IS WHERE YOU ADD ALL THE DETAILS LEFT OUT OF PRD:**
  
  - UI specifics (exact field counts, validation rules, layout details)
  - Performance targets (< 2s, 60fps, etc.)
  - Technical implementation hints (libraries, patterns, APIs)
  - Edge cases (what happens when...)
  - Validation rules (regex patterns, constraints)
  - Error handling (specific error messages, retry logic)
  - Accessibility requirements (ARIA labels, keyboard nav, screen readers)
  - Platform specifics (mobile responsive, browser support)
  
  For each epic, generate:
  
  - Epic title as `epic_title_{{N}}`
  - Epic goal/value as `epic_goal_{{N}}`
  - All stories as repeated pattern `story_title_{{N}}_{{M}}` for each story M
  
  CRITICAL for Epic 1 (Foundation):
  
  - Story 1.1 MUST be project setup/infrastructure initialization
  - Sets up: repo structure, build system, deployment pipeline basics, core dependencies
  - Creates foundation for all subsequent stories
  - Note: Architecture workflow will flesh out technical details
  
  Each story should follow BDD-style acceptance criteria:
  
  **Story Pattern:**
  As a [user type],
  I want [specific capability],
  So that [clear value/benefit].
  
  **Acceptance Criteria using BDD:**
  Given [precondition or initial state]
  When [action or trigger]
  Then [expected outcome]
  
  And [additional criteria as needed]
  
  **Prerequisites:** Only previous stories (never forward dependencies)
  
  **Technical Notes:** Implementation guidance, affected components, compliance requirements
  
  Ensure stories are:
  
  - Vertically sliced (deliver complete functionality, not just one layer)
  - Sequentially ordered (logical progression, no forward dependencies)
  - Independently valuable when possible
  - Small enough for single-session completion
  - Clear enough for autonomous implementation
  
  For each story in epic {{N}}, output variables following this pattern:
  
  - story*title*{{N}}_1, story_title_{{N}}\*2, etc.
  - Each containing: user story, BDD acceptance criteria, prerequisites, technical notes</action>

                                Review the complete epic breakdown for quality and completeness
  
  **Validate Epic Structure (USER VALUE CHECK):**
  
  For each epic, answer: "What can USERS do after this epic is complete that they couldn't do before?"
  
  - Epic 1: [Must have clear user value OR be Foundation exception]
  - Epic 2: [Must deliver user-facing capability]
  - Epic N: [Must deliver user-facing capability]
  
  ⚠️ RED FLAG: If an epic only delivers technical infrastructure (database layer, API without users, component library without features), RESTRUCTURE IT. Each epic should enable users to accomplish something.
  
  Exception validation:
  
  - Foundation epic: Acceptable as first epic for greenfield projects
  - API-first epic: Acceptable ONLY if API has standalone consumers (third-party integrations, multiple frontends, API-as-product)
  
  If any epic fails this check, restructure before proceeding.
  
  **Validate FR Coverage:**
  
  Create FR Coverage Matrix showing each FR mapped to epic(s) and story(ies):
  
  - FR1: [description] → Epic X, Story X.Y
  - FR2: [description] → Epic X, Story X.Z
  - FR3: [description] → Epic Y, Story Y.A
  - ...
  - FRN: [description] → Epic Z, Story Z.B
  
  Confirm: EVERY FR from Step 1 inventory is covered by at least one story.
  If any FRs are missing, add stories now.
  
  **Validate Story Quality:**
  
  - All functional requirements from PRD are covered by stories
  - Epic 1 establishes proper foundation (if greenfield)
  - All stories are vertically sliced (deliver complete functionality, not just one layer)
  - No forward dependencies exist (only backward references)
  - Story sizing is appropriate for single-session completion
  - BDD acceptance criteria are clear and testable
  - Details added (what was missing from PRD FRs: UI specifics, performance targets, etc.)
  - Domain/compliance requirements are properly distributed
  - Sequencing enables incremental value delivery
  
  Confirm with {user_name}:
  
  - Epic structure makes sense
  - All FRs covered by stories (validated via coverage matrix)
  - Story breakdown is actionable
